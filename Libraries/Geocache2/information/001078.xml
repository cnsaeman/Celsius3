  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-04T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Drea-Popa <br />We were looking for this cache on our way to the airport. Unfortunately we couldn't find this cache...</li><li>2010-01-31T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by CluelessTwo <br />We were in a bit of a hurry this morning as we were planning to cache our way back up north.  So it was a 10 minute look and then we gave up.  We did see the toys people chated about but the garmin was pointing into the field to a place that was just a bit of field with no where to hide anything. We searched where we thought it should be but this one stumped us, which was very annoying and a bad start to our day.
