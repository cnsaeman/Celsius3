NOTE: The above coordinates will not bring you to this cache!
<br />
<br />
This cache is a bonus cache for the "Dublin's Railway Termini"
cache series. In order to get the correct coordinates for this
cache you must find the 6 caches in this series. Using the numbers
that were printed in these caches, the coordinates for this cache
can be worked out as <br />
<br />
N53 (AxG).({I+C}x{K+H}) W6 (B+J).({F+L}x{DxE}). <br />
<br />
These coordinates will bring you to an area that is linked with the
railways. All the housing in the immediate area and the surrounding
streets were built to serve the workers on the nearby railway. The
name of the surrounding streets should tell you which railway
company constructed the dwellings!</long-description>

#182</li><li>2010-02-07T20:00:00Z : Found it by Zoe andDaddy <br />A really nice series, well worth it.

Found while out for a full day caching with Mr Frezeluberz. 40/51

Nice quick cache and dash.

Thanks</li><li>2010-02-07T20:00:00Z : Found it by Lahtac <br />Nice to finish this series off sucesfully. Lovely location. TFTC</li><li>2010-02-07T20:00:00Z : Found it by Frezeluberz <br />Found while out for the day with Zoe andDaddy.
So, here we are with all the clues in hand.
It's been a long day - time for some mental arithmetic.
K + H != K * H
That'll get you every time!!
Oops [:I] [:I]
With no hint and it now being dark we're happy to have had assistance from previous logs.
Found quickly after that.
No 40 of 50 for the day.
TFTC and TFT Series - very satisfying.
