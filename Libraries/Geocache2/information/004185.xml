  <long-description><p>This cache is placed near the memorial stone to J.B. Malone, who
first suggested that the Wicklow Way be set up in 1963.</p>
<p>In addition to writing widely on walking in the Wicklow area, he
also put together possibly the most comprehensive description of
the Wicklow Way as a guide to those who wished to undertake the
trek. He was a columnist in one of the evening papers in the
sixties, outlining routes for walks</p>
<p>A good starting point is from the car park at Ballinastoe Woods
- N 53 06.430 W 006 13.150</p>
<p>The location of this memorial stone gives spectacular views over
lake and mountain - possibly the best views available for the least
effort!</p></long-description>
