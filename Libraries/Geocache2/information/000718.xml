  <long-description>This is a multi-stage cache located on Dun Laoghaire's East Pier. The east pier is the more popular of the two main piers in the harbour, and is the ideal location for a brisk winter stroll or a sunny summer jaunt. The views from the pier across Dublin Bay to Howth are worth the visit. Bring binoculars to fully enjoy the views. If you are lucky you may spot a seal swimming nearby! There are several transport links to the cache. It can be reached from the Dun Laoghaire DART station, and the 7, 46a and 75 busses. While there is plenty of parking in the town, most of it is pay and display from Monday to Friday.  

The cache consists of several stages. At each stage you will find a clue which will help you locate the cache.
  
At the first stage, N53 17.736 W6 07.617, you will find a bandstand. Count the number of supports keeping the roof up. Subtract 5 from your answer. Call this answer (a)

Next, move on to N53 17.993 W6 07.444. Here you will find a memorial to Capt. J Mac Neil Boyd and crew who perished in 1861. On what date in February did their ship sink? NOTE: in Roman numerals, I=1, V=5 and X =10. Call your answer (b)  

Now move on to the weather station at N53 18.060 W6 07.476. In what year was the visual display unit added to the old structure? Call this answer (c)  

Now move on to the lighthouse at the end of the pier at N53 18.143 W6 07.602. Nearby you will find 3 low references to "EN ??? D 400". Call the number represented by the ??? (d).  

Now it's time to grab the cache. Head to N53 18.050 W6 0[(c*2)+(a*b*d)+(d)-5] where you should find it awaiting you! 

NOTE! In extreme wind or wet weather, or if the sea is very choppy, do not approach the cache, as the ground around the cache can become slippy.

I've put my Geocaching time in publishing caches rather than log them [:D]

Last cache of the day before the ferry home, and the last cache of our brilliant visit. Next time I get a bright idea, someone shoot me. 5.5 miles. I swear the Harbour never looked that big from the ferry in and out, all the number of times I've sailed in and out. Teach me a lesson. 

What a enjoyable set of caches. Well worth doing.

Dave </li><li>2008-02-13T20:00:00Z : Found it by geomatica <br />I was going through some old travel bags and came across a stack of work papers from when I was touring through Europe for a Surveying (Geomatic Engineering) Symposium.
Amongst it all where a few cache printouts from my fleeting 4 day stay.
I know I needed to be in in Poland as I was flying out of Warsaw in a weeks time with a stop over in Dublin and then onto LA and home to Oz.
A few friends from my time in the UK let me stay the layover so a few caches were in order.
I know I lost a little momentum around this time as there were lots of pressures with work and family life.  Needless to say, travelling across the globe did not help much.
Still, a find is a find.

By the time we got to the cache zone it was windy. Great hide and love the way that the spiders had helped with concealing the cache - 4 webs in all!
