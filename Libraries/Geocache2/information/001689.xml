  <long-description><p><font color="green" size="4">Have you got a problem with
geocaching?<br />
 Only you can answer that question for yourself.<br />
 However, taking the following quiz may help to put your
relationship to geocaching in perspective for you.<br />
 If you end up answering "yes" to three or more questions, you may
want to take a good look how your life is affected by
geocaching.</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Have you missed classes or work
because of geocaching?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you have trouble refusing
geocaching?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you need geocaching in order to
have fun at a party?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you use geocaching to build up
your self-confidence?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you use geocaching to help you
relax?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Have you tried to give up
geocaching and failed?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you crave geocaching as soon as
you wake up?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you get into trouble because of
geocaching?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you crave geocaching at a
definite time daily?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you lie to others about how
often you partake in geocaching?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Have you gotten into financial
difficulties because of geocaching?</font></li>
<li><font color="green" size="4">Do you often wish people would
just mind their own business about you and
geocaching?</font></li></ul>
<p><font color="green" size="4">I’m here to help. This cache is a
test to see how addicted to Geocaching you really
are!!!!!!!!</font></p>

page showing their 25 nearest caches, see nothing but a perfect
page full of finds. Then that new cache comes along and spoils your
pristine page. It sits there at the top of the list. Taunting you.
Staring at you like a giant unblinking eye you want to find it you
really don’t want to add it to that nagging ignore list.</font></p>
<p><font color="green" size="4">It calls out to you. "Fiiiind

25 list.</font></p>
<p><font color="green" size="4">Ahhhhh. Order again.</font></p>
<p><font color="green" size="4">The real question is, how strong

<li><font color="green" size="4">The cache is hidden in a very
uninteresting area That has a very interesting
aroma.</font></li></ul>
<p><font color="green" size="4">The only thing you have to gain
from searching out this cache is just adding another find to your

Show the world how strong you are. You can stop Geocaching anytime
you want. Really you can...</font></p>
