<center>Fingal County Hall is not what one would expect from a
County Council Headquarters. It's a contemporary beautiful
structure which is highly energy efficient and located in the heart
of Swords, Co. Dublin. In late 2000, Fingal County Hall officially
opened it's doors for business.</center>
<center>&nbsp;</center>
<center>The building was designed by the architects Bucholz and
McEvoy on foot of a public competition. It was built on the site of
Swords House, an 18th century residence which stood until the
1980's. The huge evergreen oaks and cedars that were once part of
Swords House garden still remain in front of the new offices,
integrating the building into it's environment.</center>
<center>&nbsp;</center>
<center>The County Hall is a long, thin, curved building, five
storeys high with wings projecting to the rear in the shape of an
E. The entire front of the building is concave in shape and
completely screened in glass. On top of the curved glass wall
facade lies a sweeping timber roof, which is visible from both
inside and out. On the inside, the glass fronted wall is supported
by high tension cables, all of which sit seamlessly into the
building itself.</center>
<center>&nbsp;</center>
<center>The design and construction of the glass wall was the work
of Rice Francis Richie, a company formed by an Irish engineer who
carried out similar work on the Louvre pyramid, the Pompidou Centre
in Paris and the Sydney Opera House.</center></long-description>
