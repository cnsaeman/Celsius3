 Cache Information:<br />
At the coordinates above you will find the coordinates for the
cache (a decon bax) which is only about 35 metres from my house (as
the crow flies, and you would need to be one!).<br />
The coordinates are not that easily found so you will have to have
all your wits about you. PLEASE REMEMBER TO REPLACE THE COORDINATES
CAREFULLY AS YOU FOUND THEM.<br />
The towpath can become quite muddy after wet weather so stout shoes
are recommended.PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT LARGE PARTS OF THIS TOWPATH
HAVE AREAS WITH STEEP DROPS TO THE CANAL. CYCLING THIS PARTICULAR
STRETCH CAN INDEED BE HAZARDOUS <br />
<br />
The Royal Canal Way<br />
<br />
Work commenced in 1790 and lasted 27 years before finally reaching
the Shannon in 1817, at a total cost of £1,421,954[1]. The canal
passes through Maynooth, Enfield and Mullingar and has a spur to
Longford. The total length of the main navigation is 145 km (90
mi), and the system has 46 locks. There is one main feeder (from
Lough Owel), which enters the canal at Mullingar. At the Dublin
end, the canal once reached the Liffey through a wide sequence of
dock and locks at Spencer Dock, with a final sea lock to manage
access to the river and sea, but these are no longer fully
operational, and access to the river is especially challenging.
Quaternion plaque on Brougham (Broom) Bridge, Dublin <br />
In 1843, while walking with his wife along the Royal Canal, Sir
William Rowan Hamilton realized the formula for quaternions and
carved his initial thoughts into a stone on the Brougham Bridge
over the canal. <br />
<br />
The canal is notable in that the Dublin - Mullingar railway line
was built alongside the canal for much of the distance. The
meandering route of the canal ensures a speed limiting curvature
for the railway. The canal was bought by the Midland Great Western
Railway to provide a route to the West of Ireland, originally
planning to close the canal and build the railway along its bed.
<br />
The canal travels across one of the major junctions on the M50/N3
in a specially constructed aqueduct. <br />
Today Waterways Ireland is responsible for the canal. It is
currently being repaired, and it is intended to reopen it for
navigation of its full length (from the Shannon Navigation to
Dublin) by the middle of 2008. In early 2007, it is possible to go
from Dublin to Ballymahon, and boats of up to 22.9m x 4.0m x 1.2m
are allowed. Access points currently exist near Leixlip and at
Maynooth, Enfield, Thomastown, Mullingar, Ballinea Bridge and
Ballynacargy. In 2006 a commemoration marker was erected at Piper's
Boreen, Mullingar, to mark the 200 years since the canal reached
Mullingar in 1806.<br />
<br />
This cache is part of a series placed along the Royal Canal Way.
The series follows the towpaths along the Royal Canal heading
westwards towards the Shannon River. There are a number of caches
in the Dublin region stretching from the city centre out into the
country. Except for the first two centre city caches all of the
waypoints for these caches take you in the direction against the
water flow. To get the full benefit of this series I would suggest
that it is best done on foot or on a bicycle though most of the
caches may also be accessed by car. I have to say that the car
option will take considerable time, petrol and nausea inducing
traffic frustration not to mention considerable difficulty with
parking.</long-description>
