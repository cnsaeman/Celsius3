  <long-description><p>Ardgillan is a very well preserved castle near Skerries to the
North of Dublin, surrounded by beautiful gardens and set in a great
landscape. From the cache, you will have spectacular views over the
grounds and over Skerries Bay and the Skerries town.A visit to the
castle is highly recommended.</p>
<p>There are two ways to get to this cache: from the main car park
at N 53 34.922 W 006 09.645, or the pedestrain route at the "Ladies
Stairs" at N 53 35.473 W 006 09.365.</p>
<p>If you want to visit this cache using public transport, the bus
route to take from Dublin City centre is the No. 33 which will drop
you off at the "Ladies Stairs" on the road between Balbriggan and
Skerries, the pedestrian entrance to the Demesne via a bridge which
spans the road and railway line. Alternatively, you can take the 41
from Dublin City Centre to Swords, and then take the 33A (which
from Swords on follows the same route as the 33).</p>
<p><b>Note that access to the grounds is open from 10am to 5pm in
the Wintertime, and 10am to 9pm in the summer (June, July and
August).</b></p>
