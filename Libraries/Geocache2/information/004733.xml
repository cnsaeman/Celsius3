<p><b>The Loughshinny Folds</b></p></center></description>
  <long-description><p>Loughshinny is a tiny fishing-village on the coast of County
Dublin, about midway between the larger villages of Rush and
Skerries.</p>
<p>The area is well known to geologists from Dublin for the fine
exposures of contorted strata exhibited in the neighbouring cliffs.
These exposures form part of an extensive coast-section of
Carboniferous rocks which may be followed, with a few
interruptions, for about 8 kilometers from Rush on the south to
Skerries on the north.</p>
<p>The geology of Loughshinny is remarkable in that it of layers of
grey limestone and black shales formed about 300 million years
ago.<br />
The visible folding of the rocks happened later, about 290 million
years ago.<br />
 This process resulted in chevron or zigzag folds the axial planes
of the folds (anticlines and synclines) tilt to the south with
overturned northern limbs, Some fossils, crinoids, bivalves and
corals, can be seen in some of the beds.<br />
 All of which can be seen a short walk from Loughshinny
Harbour.</p>
<p>The rocks that occur in County Dublin are all, with the
exception of the latest Pleistocene glacial tills, of Paleozoic age
having been formed between 590 and 350 million years ago during the
Cambrian to Carboniferous periods.</p>
<p><b>Geological periods in the Paleozoic Era:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Permian 248 – 286 million years</li>
<li>Carboniferous 286 – 360 million years</li>
<li>Devonian 360 – 408 million years</li>
<li>Silurian 408 – 438 million years</li>
<li>Ordovician 438 – 505 million years</li>
<li>Cambrian 505 – 590 million years</li></ul>
<p>To log your visit please answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the name of the county that the Devonian period is
named after?</li>
<li>The Permian period was named after which kingdom?</li>
<li>Who named the Permian period and when was it named?</li>
<li>Estimate the length and height of the folds at the above
coordinates.</li>
<li>A photo is also required which must show you or your gps on
Loughshinny beach.</li></ul>
<p>Please post the photo and email me the answers to the questions
asked. Logs that do not include all the answers will be
