Leixlip Louisa Bridge is a railway station in Leixlip, County Kildare, Ireland. Originally named Louisa Bridge & Leixlip when it opened on 1 September 1848[1], the station was known simply as Leixlip from 1851[citation needed] until the opening of Leixlip Confey railway station in 1990. Both modern stations lie on the Dublin to Longford commuter route[1].

The station was upgraded to two platforms as part of the Western Commuter upgrade project in the early 2000s. At the same time it was reconstructed to be disability friendly. It is one of the very few stations in the Iarnród Éireann network in which the station building is located directly over the platforms, on a bridge (the modern Dun Laoghaire railway station also follows this design). A previous station building is now a dwelling house.</long-description>

Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

We had to kill some time, before heading to the airport; so we decided to look for some cache on the way. Failed at this one.

Thanks for this one...
