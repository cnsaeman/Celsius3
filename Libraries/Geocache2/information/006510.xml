  <long-description><p>Bird life on the island has been protected by legislation since
the 1930s, and it was designated a national nature reserve in 1988.
It is listed by UNESCO as a Biosphere reserve. Bird species on the
island include Pale-bellied Brent Goose, curlews, oystercatchers,
grey plovers and shovelers. There are 6 terrestrial mammal species
on the island: brown rat, fox, field-mouse, hedgehog, Irish hare,
and rabbit.</p>
<p>Take a stroll or park your car on the beach and you may even see
some Kite surfers. With a declared kitesurfing launch area the
shallow water and long stretch of straight beach allows for safe
kite-surfing. This has encouraged many beginners to take up the
sport on the island.</p>
<p><b>Stage one</b></p>
<p>Go to the above co-ords (N53.22.139. W006.08.626 as per top of
page)</p>
<p>At this location note the speed limit call this <b>AB</b></p>
<p><b>Stage Two</b></p>
<p>Go to N53 22.148 W6 08.878 and check out the sign and obtain
some figures:</p>
<p>How many rabbits call this number <b>C</b></p>
<p>How many birds are in the main picture call this <b>DE</b></p>
<p><b>Stage Three</b></p>
<p>Go to N53.22.314 W6.09.137 and check out the information and
obtain a figure</p>
<p>How many thousand of waders and wildfowl were there in 1997 call
this first digit <b>F</b></p>
<p><b>Final location</b></p>
<p><b>N53.DD.A(A+C+D)(D*F) W006.B(A+C+F).(A*A)(A*A)(D+E+F)</b></p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by eve1987 <br />A very nice multi which i've done when GudrunXY was on the Westlife-concert in Corke-park [;)]

TFTC, eve</li><li>2010-05-21T19:00:00Z : Found it by GudrunXY <br />I made it backwards and of course had to go the double route.
TFTC, GudrunXY</li><li>2010-04-28T19:00:00Z : Found it by anacreon <br />Found despite some confusion between this and a nearby earthcache. A little tricky searching but found the box eventually. TFTC!</li><li>2010-04-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by Balla & Silly <br />After finding the answers for the Earthcache we could also find this multi on beautiful North Bull Island. Dollier Strand wasn't very busy in the late afternoon, the wind was still too cold. But some kite-surfers enjoyed the challenge and it was fun watching them.
It was no problem to find the stages and the final. The cache was unhidden on the ground, we hid it again where we thought it was originally.

Thanks a lot for this nice cache and many regards,
