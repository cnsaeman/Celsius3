  <long-description><p align="justify">Prior to the 17th century, the north side of
Townsend was a tidal strand of the Liffey. To the south there was
an elevated ridge near the confluence of the rivers Liffey and
Dodder and that was the place where Dublin Vikings generally
landed. Old records refer to this place as “The Stein” or
“Steine”.<br />
<br />
 The name “Steine” has got Scandinavian roots and comes from
“stone”. Some records mention a pillar stone standing there.
Destruction or moving this stone is not recorded, and its function
is not clear. Most likely it was a cult stone (dedicated to Freya
or Thor) but other theories mention a memory stone, a mark of
possession or a seamark (for navigation).<br />
<br />
 In the 1970's a replica was erected near the original
location.<br />

<font color="red"><b>Please retrieve and hide the cache with
extreme care because it’s a highly muggled area.</b></font></p>
