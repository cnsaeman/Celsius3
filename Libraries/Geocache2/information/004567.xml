  <description>In the shadow of the Cross, the place where thousands once stood to
greet the man from the "City of the seven hills" Within sight of
the "White House from the Land of the Free"</description>
  <long-description>All items are individually packaged in zip-lock bags. As usual,
take whatever tickles your fancy, and remember, you don’t have to
replace an item of equal value, but if you can by all means do so. 
<p>Located in an open area with no cover, it had to be put below
ground level, but it should stick out to those who seek it. *** Be
careful when adding a log as it is easy to give too much away
(making it too easy for future seekers to find the cache). I have
had to encrypt a couple of logs from finders because of this.
***</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
<p>The Champions.</p></long-description>
  <encoded-hints>Hidden underground, but clearly marked with a cement slab. The Cross in question is the Papal Cross where Pope John Paul came and held a mass there around 1980 and one can also see the American Ambassadors residence,"The White House," not too far away!</encoded-hints>
