<p>There are some thirty-eight lodges with living
accommodation<br />

eleven<br />

visitors can explore freely.</p>

If you're going to do all the caches here you should definitely drive or rent a bike!  Also, the park is always busy (it was pretty chilly when we were there and there were folks running, walking, playing cricket...) so you have to watch out for muggles.  TFTC!
