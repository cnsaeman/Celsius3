  <long-description><p>At The above location there are the remains of a stone windmill
on a circular plinth.<br />
The mill is only one of around 100 windmills known to have been
worked in the then grain-rich county.</p>
<p>The mill is on private property there is no need to cross the
open fields to the mill to find the cache</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The cache is a small micro please rehide it well to prevent
muggles from discovering its location</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-08T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />This was a 'Windsockers' themed day of cache finds around the airport.  This was #5 of 7.

Very interesting site.  Thanks for bringing us here.

SL TFTC</li><li>2010-04-11T19:00:00Z : Found it by Pitri & Benns <br />We found this cache during our two-week tour around Ireland. Without all these caches we would not have seen many of the nice places we have been! Thanks a million

Pitri & Benns from Germany

We sadly had to discover that ca each second cache has been wet sometimes with the log mouldy. Please check by your cache as soon as possible to change the log!

</li><li>2010-04-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by keebee <br />Found with Gushoneybun.
Shame you can not walk to the windmill. 
TfTc</li><li>2010-04-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by gushoneybun <br />This took a moment to spot. Interesting location, thanks for showing it to us. The log book was damp so it might be worth changing when you are next passing, it is still servicable so no mad rush. Thanks for this one.
