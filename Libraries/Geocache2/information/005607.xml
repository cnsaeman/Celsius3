<center><b>Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening</b></center>

<center><br />
Whose woods these are I think I know.<br />
His house is in the village though;<br />
He will not see me stopping here<br />
To watch his woods fill up with snow.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>My little horse must think it queer<br />
To stop without a farmhouse near<br />
Between the woods and frozen lake<br />
The darkest evening of the year.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>He gives his harness bells a shake<br />
To ask if there is some mis<!--SELECTION-->
<!--/SELECTION-->take.<br />
The only other sound's the sweep<br />
Of easy wind and downy flake.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br />
But I have promises to keep,<br />
And miles to go before I sleep,<br />
