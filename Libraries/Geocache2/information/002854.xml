TFTC GudrunXY</li><li>2010-05-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by Nachtwolf <br />Hello.
After our boating holydays on the beautiful River Shannon we spent a few days in Dublin.

I explored this interesting lively city on foot and visited some caches. I had no problems to discover the sculpture, to fulfil the tasks and to find the cache. 

Attention: The log-book is wet!!!

Thank you for this very nice cache and greetings from Germany
Nachtwolf</li><li>2009-12-29T20:00:00Z : Write note by Kersti.com <br />While the cache is still in place, the recent bad weather has certainly taken it's toll. I'm currently away so can't get to it for the next couple of weeks but will sort it out as soon as possible.</li></ul></logs>
