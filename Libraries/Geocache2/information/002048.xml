  <description>A short walk from the city centre with nice views.</description>
  <long-description>Down by the water you'll  see what life was like in the past and what it is still like for millions of people around the world. You will see names of some of Ireland's famous people and remember those who you will never know.

E-mail me with the answer to the following question to claim a find.

On what exact date did the Canadian Prime Minister visit here?
