  <long-description><p>As far back as the late 1800&rsquo;s a GAA team has been playing
on the Donabate peninsula back then the team was known as
&lsquo;The Old Shilleaghs&rsquo;.<br />
Modern history of the club began in 1924 with the establishment of
the Fingal League and the club was renamed St. Patrick&rsquo;s GAA
Club. League wins for the club are recorded as far back as 1932 and
history shows that the 30&rsquo;s were a successful time for the
club. But you don&rsquo;t have to go back that far for club
successes at St. Pat&rsquo;s. Dublin Junior Championship 1980,
Dublin Minor Champions 1991, AFL Div. 6 Champions 2006, Under 21
Champions 2007 and reigning Dublin Minor Champions Div.5. Dublin
Junior Championship 2008 and runners-up AFL 5 2008 has brought
promotion for the First Senior Team to AFL Division 4, with the
Second Senior Team also being promoted to AFL Div. 10.Looking
forward is what St. Patrick&rsquo;s GAA Club is all about. It is a
thriving club, fielding twelve teams catering for boys, girls and
means football. There is also a very active Nursery section for 4-8
year old boys and girls to learn and develop their skills in a fun
environment. A &ldquo;Street League&rdquo; is run every year, with
over two hundred children participating. The league finishes off
with the Street League final and a family fun day which last summer
brought in over a thousand participants and spectators.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The Cache is a micro container.<br />
<br />
Please take care and rehide the cache to prevent muggles from<br />
discovering its location.</p>
