<h2>The idea behind the COVO LOCOs</h2>
All nice places in your region are already full of caches? You've
already found all the caches near your home? You're not in the mood
to go far from your home to find a cache but you're missing the
sensation of the hunt? Then this is the solution: the COVO LOCO - a
series of caches in the stile of a chain letter! Who finds a COVO
LOCO can hide a new one! <br />
<h2>The Statutes</h2>
<br />
<b>§1</b>: The type of a COVO LOCO is always "traditional"! <br />
<br />
<b>§2</b>: COVO LOCOs have to be easily accessable by car! Avoid
long walks on foot! <br />
<br />
<b>§3</b>: Every listing of a COVO LOCO has to have a very clear
hint! <br />
<br />
<b>§4</b>: The caches have to be named like "COVO LOCO #(number of
four digits)"! In this way they can be distinguished from caches
made with love in nice places. <br />
<br />
<b>§5</b>: The numbers of the COVO LOCO range from #0001 to #9999!
Prior to the publication of a new COVO LOCO you need to register
your favoured number at
<a href="http://www.covoloco.eu">www.covoloco.eu</a>! <br />
<br />
<b>§6</b>: The listing of a new COVO LOCO has to contain these
statutes! <br />
<br />
<b>§7</b>: Every finder of a COVO LOCO can place a new COVO LOCO
himself - <br />
<i>violation of this will be punished with 5 DNFs in a line by the
Lord of the Caches! *ggg*</i><br />
<br />
<center><a href="http://www.covoloco.eu" target="_blank">Go to Covo
Loco</a></center>
<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT!!! §7 it is purely voluntary and should not be considered
an Additional Logging Requirement, nobody has to hide a cache to
claim this find.<br />
<br />
" Maintenance for this cache will be provided by a local cacher
their details are on file with Geocaching" <br />

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Just a formality, cause we were here for the europe's first [:D]
Nevertheless, it's a nice place, nice view, and the star of great trail near the ocean.

Thanks for this one...
