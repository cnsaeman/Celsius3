<p><b>Skerries railway station is located on the main
Dublin-Belfast Railway line.</b></p></center>
<p>The station was opened in 1844. The Great Northern Railway later
added a number of other buildings to the original station following
its takeover in 1876, these included the GNR signal cabin canopies,
brick built goods shed complete with engineers siding and loop
Skerries also has a subway, one of few at Irish stations.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>Side-Tracked Caches are intended to provide quick
Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations.</p>
<p>The Cache is a small micro container please rehide it well to
prevent the many muggles from discovering it.</p>
