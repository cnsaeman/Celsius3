<b>Croke Park</b> (Irish: P&#225;irc an Chr&#243;caigh) in Dublin,
Ireland is the largest sports stadium in Ireland. It is the
principal stadium and headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic
Association (GAA), Ireland's biggest sporting organisation.
"Croker", as it is often called by Dubliners, is in the heart of
the city, a 15 minute walk from the main thoroughfare O'Connell
Street. With a capacity of 82,300, it is the fourth largest stadium
in Europe and the current largest stadium in the Six Nations
Championship.<br />
<br />
Since 1884 the site has been used primarily by the GAA to host
Gaelic games, most notably the annual finals of the All-Ireland
Senior Football Championship and Senior Hurling Championship.<br />
<br />
History of Croke Park - The site upon which Croke Park now stands
was originally owned by Dublin businessman Maurice Butterly. Known
as the &#8216;City and Suburban Racecourse&#8217; in the
1870&#8217;s, his most frequent tenant was the GAA. In 1908 Frank
Dineen of Limerick, a journalist and former President and Secretary
of the GAA, bought the almost derelict site for &#163;3,250. The
GAA subsequently purchased the site in 1913 for &#163;3,500 and
renamed the ground Croke Park in honour of the association&#8217;s
first patron, Archbishop Croke of Cashel. Over the next 40 years,
Croke Park was developed and redeveloped in an ad hoc manner as
finances allowed.<br />
<br />
The <b>Railway End</b>, now known as the Dineen <b>Hill 16</b>, was
built from the rubble left in Sackville Street (now O&#8217;Connell
Street) after the 1916 rising. The <b>Hogan Stand</b> built in 1924
was named after Tipperary footballer Michael Hogan, who was fatally
shot on the pitch in Croke Park by British troops along with 13
others on Bloody Sunday 1920. The <b>Cusack Stand</b>, named after
one of the original founders of the GAA Michael Cusack, followed in
1937. The <b>Canal End</b> terrace, named after the Royal Canal
which runs behind it, was developed as a fully terraced facility in
1949, greatly improving the comfort and view for spectators at the
southern end of the ground. The construction of the <b>Nally
Stand</b> followed in 1952, named after Fenian Pat Nally. Since
these initial buildings, reconstruction and redevelopment of
various sections of the ground have taken place.<br />

<p style="text-align:left"><b>Four Phases of Redevelopment 1995 -
2005</b><br />
<i>Phase One</i> - demolition of the old Cusack Stand and by summer
1995 the new Cusack Stand became part of the Dublin skyline at a
cost of &#163;35 million. The new stand is 180 meters long, 35
meters high, has a capacity for 25,000 people and contains 46
hospitality suites.<br />
<br />
<i>Phase Two</i> - demolition of the Canal End Terrace and
extension of the new stand completed in time for the 2000 All
Ireland finals, started in late 1998 and involved extending the new
Cusack Stand. It is now known as The Davin Stand (Irish: Ard&#225;n
D&#225;imh&#237;m), after Maurice Davin, the first president of the
GAA. This phase also saw the creation of a tunnel which was later
named the Ali tunnel in honour of Muhammad Ali and his fight in
Croke Park.<br />
<br />
<i>Phase Three</i> - the Hogan Stand completed the
&#8220;horseshoe&#8221; effect. This required a greater variety of
spectator categories to be accommodated including general
spectators, corporate patrons, VIPs, broadcast and media services
and operation staff. Extras included a fitted-out mezzanine level
for VIP and Ard Comhairle (Where the dignitaries sit) along with a
top-level press media facility.<br />
<br />
<i>Phase Four</i> &#8211; construction began in September 2003
replacing the old Hill 16 and Nally Stands with modern terraces
that increased the capacity of the stadium to 82,300. This final
phase was completed and officially opened by An Taoiseach in March
2005.</p>

<p><b>Croke Park Plays Host through the Years:</b><br />
<br />
&#8226; As far back as 1953 Croke Park hosted a demonstration of
American Football in aid of the Irish Red Cross society.<br />
&#8226; In the 60&#8217;s, the Galahs played Australian Rules
Football in the stadium.<br />
&#8226; In 1972, the great Muhammad Ali came to Croke Park amidst a
fanfare of publicity to defeat Al &#8220;Blue&#8221; Lewis.<br />
&#8226; By the 1980&#8217;s, the International Rules series had
been established to match the cream of Gaelic football against
their counterparts from the Australian Football League.<br />
&#8226; Most recently in 2007, the stadium opened its doors to
Rugby and Soccer while the Lansdowne Road site is being
redeveloped. (On 16 April 2005, a motion to temporarily relax rule
#42 was passed, enabling rugby & soccer to be played on GAA
pitches. Rule 42 prohibited the use of GAA property for games with
interests in conflict with the interests of the GAA.)<br />
&#8226; Croke Park has also proudly hosted the opening and closing
ceremonies of the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003, the
first time these events were held outside the United States.<br />
&#8226; And of course the stadium has staged concerts featuring
great international artists such as Tina Turner, Garth Brooks, Bon
Jovi, Billy Joel, Elton John, Robbie Williams and U2.<br />
&#8226; It has also held the world record for largest attendance at
a club rugby union match since 2 May 2009.<br />

Mimiata (USA)</li><li>2010-06-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by poohbear50 <br />WR brought me for a surprise week-end to Dublin which I thought was very nice but the biggest surprise was yet to come. Saturday night I found myself amongst hordes of people and as I was so busy trying to extracate myself from the crowds I didn't take much notice of where or why they were here. My only concern was to get away. Seeing my state of mind WR invited me for a drink, with a glass of wine in front of me he informed me that I was going to see West Life. I just couldn't believe my good fortune. I have to say that at this point I didn't see the crowds as all I was thinking about was getting in to Croagh Park to see and hear West Life. On our way down WR reminded me that we were going for a cache before we went into the Park. Got to GZ but with 85,000 people descending down on us and the fact that GZ was protected with two Garda we were unable to sign the log while Croagh Park writes another chapter in its history and we were part of it. Memorable night. TFTC </li><li>2010-06-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by Wild Rover <br />Croker - Westlife and a cache what more can you ask for - oh yes a whole new meaning to muggle central as 85,000 converged for the concert. GZ was "guarded" by a couple of Garda so we could not actually retrieve it - subject to owners acceptance we have logged a find on the grounds that we did quite a bit more than read the history we became part of it! TFTC</li><li>2010-06-03T19:00:00Z : Found it by eve1987 <br />Together with GudrunXY it was a quick find :)

TFTC and kind regards from Austria, eve</li><li>2010-06-03T19:00:00Z : Found it by GudrunXY <br />A quick find with eve1987 on our caching tour through Ireland.

Saturday night I found myself amongst hordes of people and as I was so busy trying to extracate myself from the crowds I didn't take much notice of where or why they were here. My only concern was to get away. Seeing my state of mind WR invited me for a drink, with a glass of wine in front of me he informed me that I was going to see West Life. I just couldn't believe my good fortune. I have to say that at this point I didn't see the crowds as all I was thinking about was getting in to Croagh Park to see and hear West Life. On our way down WR reminded me that we were going for a cache before we went into the Park. Got to GZ but with 85,000 people descending down on us and the fact that GZ was protected with two Garda we were unable to sign the log while Croagh Park writes another chapter in its history and we were part of it. Memorable night. TFTC </groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Croker - Westlife and a cache what more can you ask for - oh yes a whole new meaning to muggle central as 85,000 converged for the concert. GZ was "guarded" by a couple of Garda so we could not actually retrieve it - subject to owners acceptance we have logged a find on the grounds that we did quite a bit more than read the history we became part of it!
