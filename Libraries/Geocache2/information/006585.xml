  <description>The nano is attached to a super magnet, so be careful to replace the nano back on it as the magnetic strength of the nano by itself isn't all that strong. 


Don't forget to bring your own pen :)

  <long-description>The 10 Commandments of this cache

1. You shall seek out many a cache hereafter this one

2. You shall not place for yourself a cache beside this one

3. You shall not take the name of another cacher in vain
    (Even if it is your 3rd DNF on a cache of theirs)

4. Remember, any day makes for a good caching day

5. Honor your geocaching mentor(s) 

6. You shall not muggle this cache

7. You shall replace this cache EXACTLY as you found it

8. You shall do all in your power to prevent a muggle discovering the cache location

9. You shall not lie about finding this cache, & then log that you did

AND FINALLY:.....

10. Hear no DNF, See no DNF, Speak no DNF !</long-description>
