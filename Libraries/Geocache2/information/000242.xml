Surprised this evening to see this one hadn't been found so we took a run into the Park. 
Picked up the last of the clues, did the maths, rooted around and viola! There was the cache. 
Co-ords jumping a bit with the tree, maybe 8mts off GZ. Less at times, with 2 sat navs got repeated different co-ords. 
We were approached by a resident of the nearby lodge, who was a bit worried that we might have a "stash" there, (not sure what to think about that - do we look like we might be "stashing" stuff [:)] ) Anyhow, as he seems to have seen several people around the place and was getting alarmed, at first we said we were on a treasure hunt, he thought Bloomsday & wanted to know our clue & help... now he knows about geocaching and is aware the cache is somewhere around and thinks that's "cool", He assured us the area is not "Private property", although the car park at the back is. Nice guy, if you see him or his girlfriend/wife watching from the upstairs window just wave [:)]
TFTC & the series, makes for a nice walk around this lovely amenity, which we live quite close to and tend to take for granted. We have enjoyed the whole series.
