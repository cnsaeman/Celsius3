  <long-description><p>While most people know that both Stephen Roche and Mark Scanlon
were world champion cyclists not many know that Harry Reynolds was
Ireland’s first, ever, cycling world champion.</p>
<p>Harry Reynolds was born in Balbriggan, the eldest son of Julia
and Robert Reynolds. Both parents died when the Reynolds family
were still young, and the children were raised by their relatives.
At the age of 18, Harry developed an interest in cycling and joined
the local Wanderers Cycling Club along with two of his younger
brothers Bob and Jack.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the youngster to start winning and in
1893 a weekly sports newspaper imaginatively titled ‘Sport’ stated
that “Some smart novices were unearthed in the Wanderers race on
Wednesday, notably Mulheir and Reynolds. Who would ever think that
Reynolds would administer a thrashing to Lord for the Time Trophy.
This time, 38’50”, leaves one to fancy that great things may be
expected of him in the near future.”</p>
<p>The young Harry rode in a number of races that summer and at the
end of July won a Three Mile Handicap at Skerries Sports. He was
also second in the Five Mile Handicap. A week later he won the
Three Mile Handicap at Balbriggan Sports by a couple of inches and
in September went on to win both the Three and five Mile Handicaps
at the GAA Championships in Jones’ Road, Dublin. “Reynolds is
likely to have a brilliant future” read the pages of Sport.</p>
<p>A brilliant future he had. 1894 saw him win the One Mile Scratch
race at Dublin Metropolitan Sports, both the Three Mile Handicap
and the Scratch race at Dundalk and the 10 miles Championship of
Ireland.</p>
<p>In 1895 Reynolds won both the 5 Mile and 50 Miles championships
of Ireland and decided to try his luck in England. That summer he
entered and easily won the 100 Guinea Cup at the Kennington Oval,
London, against 25 selected riders over a distance of 10 miles. He
was awarded the gold medal but would have to win the race two years
in succession to take home the coveted Cup.</p>
<p>On Whit Monday of the next year, Reynolds won three events at
the Waterford Sports – The One Mile Handicap, the 10 Miles scratch
for the Gold Shield and the Five Miles Open Handicap. The following
Saturday, he rode in the 10 miles scratch race in the Ulster
Championships in Belfast and had lapped the field after six
miles!</p>
<p>Reynolds was on form to defend his 100 Guinea Cup and hoped to
bring the trophy home with him to Ireland, but the British Cycling
Union announced that he was “ineligible”, and refused to give any
explanation as to why.</p>
<p>The Irish Cyclists Association decided to send him to the World
Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark instead.</p>
<p>Harry trained on the Cat ford track in London and arrived in
Denmark in August 1896. He won two warm-up races over distances of
one kilometre and 3500 metres. In the latter he defeated Rodolfsen
and Kundmelson of Denmark, despite both of them having a 30-metre
start on him.</p>
<p>In the One Mile Amateur Championships of the World, on Saturday
15th August, 1896, Harry Reynolds was drawn in the seventh and
final heat of the first round. Harry won, in the third fastest
heat, beating opponents Niebbing of Holland and Oslund of Norway.
In the second round he beat Johnsen of Sweden and Marseth of Norway
by ten yards after leading from the gun and found himself in the
final.</p>
<p>Reynolds later became the first Irish World Cycling Champion
when beating Schrader of Denmark and Guillaumet of France by the
narrowest of margins, after a slow tactical start to the race.</p>
<p>Having become World champion, Reynolds was stepping onto the
podium to be presented with his medal by the King of Denmark when
the band started playing “God Save The Queen” as a Union Jack was
hoisted alongside the podium. Reynolds threw down his bike in
anger, called the officials, pointing out that he was Irish and
would not have his victory accredited to England. At his request,
The Danes lowered the Union Jack, replacing it with a green flag
and the band played an Irish song.</p>
<p>News of Reynolds victory spread like wildfire in Ireland and his
reaction on the podium, helped turn him into a national hero. The
Irish Daily Independent, 25th August 1896 reported that a reception
committee would be waiting in the Irish Cycling Association offices
in D’Olier Street. It stated that Harry Reynolds would arrive by
Mail-Steamer at Kingston Dock at five o’clock on the Sunday evening
and would be escorted to the reception. The escort was to be
accompanied by a number of bands and a reputed 150,000 people
turned up to welcome the new world champion, only to find that he
had missed the boat!</p>
<p>Harry Reynolds is a legend in Balbriggan. It is common knowledge
that he used to race the steam train from Balbriggan to Skerries
for training. Renowned for his brutish strength, he also rode up
Barnageera Hill (between Skerries and Balbriggan, under the railway
tunnel on the way to Ardgillen Castle) on a fixed wheel, backwards
– for a bet – which he duly won! (Don’t try that at home!)</p>

Stages 1 and 2 were fine – but despite searching long and hard at (and around) the final co-ordinates, I didn’t find the cache. I see from previous logs that I’m not the 1st to DNF here – but I’m the 1st to be honest and log one.
