<br />
The Howth Cliff Walk offers the walker a fine, varied walk around
an open hillside and the Howth cliffs, with the guarantee of
plentiful bird life, excellent sea views and colourful wild
flowers. <br />
<br />
The walk can be commenced at many different places along the route,
with many easy access points from various car parks that are
conveniently located close to the path. This caching trail
commences at the car park 1km to the east of the village (N53
23.137 W6 03.048) and moves slowly south, then west, but can also
be undertaken in a reverse order. <br />
<br />
While the main walk is generally not very steep, a couple of caches
may require some scrambling up brief stretches of steep terrain. As
always in Ireland it is advised to bring along good waterproof
clothing for the inevitable shower. Sturdy footware is also a must.
If you wish to undertake the entire walk in one go it makes sense
to bring a packed lunch and plenty of liquids, as the full journey
may take in the region of 4-5 hours. <br />
<br />
This cache overlooks the sadly named Doldrum Bay. It is possible to
get down to the beach below, but when I visited the area there were
some people living on the beach, so I decided not to place a cache
there! Instead this should make for a relatively easy find! Please
note that the cache may get covered by falling leaves, so you might
need to dig around a little to find it!</long-description>
