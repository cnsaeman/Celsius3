  <long-description><p>The village of Garristown is recorded in the civil survey of
1654. There was a medieval church on the site of the now former
Church of Ireland. The current street pattern can be discerned in
Rocques map of 1746 and it is probable that the settlement dates
from before that, possibly the late 16th or early 17th century. The
development of the village has been slow and measured partly due
its rural location and partly due to population decline over the
last 150 years. The old RIC barracks, located in the centre of the
village is indicative of the importance of the village as an
administrative centre for the northwestern part of the county in
the early part of last century.</p>

As I (Abbey) navigated our way to GZ, I thought i saw the likely hiding spot. As i started to search for the cache i heard Ackbar say "Got it!". How he thought it would be there, i'll never know. Great hiding spot! I'm glad we didn't have to search for too long, as the rain clouds were closing in on us.
