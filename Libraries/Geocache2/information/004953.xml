even after rain.</p>

<p>Lough Ouler sits on the northeast flank of Tonelagee Mountain at
an altitude of 570 metres. Where the lake sits now was once the
source of a glacier during the Ice Age. The glacier gradually
gouged out through erosion a bowl shaped chunk of the mountain
(known as a corrie). After the ice melted away, water gathered at
the base of the corrie forming Lough Ouler. Looking down at the
lake from the top of Tonelagee Mountain the Lake is distinctly
heart shaped.</p>
<p>There is no waymarked trail to the Lake and to get there you
must be properly equipped for hillwalking. The main access points
are the Wicklow Gap and Glenmacnass Waterfall carparks.</p>
<p>In “A Guide to the County of Wicklow” George Newenham Wright
described Lough Ouler as follows :</p>
<p>”About half a mile from the head of the waterfall, upon the side
of Tonelagee Mountain, is a small circular pool, called Lough
Ouler. The brow of Tonelagee exhibits bold and sublime precipices,
500 feet in height, hanging over and darkening the face of the
water: the gloomy retirement of this spot has excited the attention
of some romantic fancy, and a few years since, a little poem called
Lough Ouler was published, the scene of which is laid here. At a
particular period of the year, says the poet, a pillar of flame is
seen traversing the surface of the lake, in a direction towards an
elevated on the margin of the lake, like a Danish rath, called the
Lochlin Burying-ground, where it vanishes from the view. The poet
supposes the fiery pillar to be a luminous nebulae, enveloping a
chariot, which conveys a warrior of the days of old, with his fair
mistress, who once possessed these rude domains. The lake contains
a great abundance of large bog trout, considered by the inhabitants
of the glen as of the very worst description, having large heads,
and being always poor and soft; there is only this one species in
the lough. The geological character of the mountains here is not
different from other parts of the range frequently mentioned
already, mica slate and granite prevailing. Tonelagee Mountain,
which is here seen in all it’s majestic sublimity, is the next in
magnitude (i.e, mass of matter) and elevation to Lugnaquilla,
being, according to Mr. Griffiths measurement, 2,696 feet above the
low water mark.”</p>
<p>The description above may strike some who are familiar with the
area as being somewhat inaccurate, particularly in getting the
lough to fit into a “small circular pool”. The lough is clearly
heart shaped and warrants a more generous description than “pool”!
Nor is Tonelagee second to Lugnaquilla – at 2,686 feet it is not as
tall as it’s neighbour, Mullaghcleevaun, which stands at 2,788
feet. The poem appears to have disappeared into the ether over the
years. From the brief outline given, we might easily find that
there are many similar mythological accounts in the area. The
description of the trout is quite unappealing – on reading it, one
can only wonder how they came to be there in the first place! There
are many other features in the area which have not been deemed
worthy of note by the writer, not least the craggy Scarr or Kanturk
across the valley. The boggy waste of Barnacullia, which leads
North to majestic Mullaghcleevaun is also worth mentioning, if only
to warn that it should be avoided! Nearby, Glenmacnass waterfall is
not the highest in Wicklow, that honour going to the cascades in
Powerscourt, but it is nevertheless an attractive feature. In spite
of the plentiful warning signs, there are frequent accidents and,
sometimes, fatalities when unprepared visitors venture out on to
the slippery rocks at the head of the falls. Twisting on between
moor and mountain towards Sallygap on the Military Road provides
some spectacular views. Situated as they are, Tonelagee and Lough
Ouler ensure that the walker, or indeed, those travelling on two
wheels, can take in at their leisure some of the finest views in
Wicklow, if not Ireland as a whole. From Tonelagee, to the South
West, the Brockaghs provide a pleasant descent into Laragh village,
where there is a hostelry for the jaded. Regarding transport, there
are not many options if you are not travelling by car – the St
Kevin’s bus to Glendalough is probably your safest bet. The cache
coordinates are contained in this last section of text – when you
twig the code, all will be revealed!</p></long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-03-06T20:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />Needed some help with the code for this one. Very clever, but very complicated too, not sure I ever would have figured it out alone!
We got to the extremely busy car park and set off across the river. There wasn't any set route so we just followed the arrow for the most part through the heather. 
The lake was completely frozen when we got to it and we sat down and had our lunch and grabbed the cache. 
Thanks for the nice walk!</li><li>2010-03-06T20:00:00Z : Found it by Donnacha <br />Found while out with Fjon today. Thanks.</li><li>2010-03-06T20:00:00Z : Write note by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Coin drop!</li><li>2010-02-27T20:00:00Z : Found it by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Simply stunning! The views, the walk, the cache contents...everything about it.

Only got the co-ords during the week after a helpful nudge in the right direction from Fjon.

We took the highroad on this and ended up having to slide down the ice to get to GZ. Tough find and some very deep holes that were covered by the snow...I found one of these the hard way!!!

Out: Decon Box
In: 2x GC

Thanks for a truly fantastic cache.

On a side note it would appear that Ginger 4x4 forgot to sign the log book when he "found" it last as the only other log was Sean's.

   

</li><li>2009-07-16T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kili or bust <br />Wow, this was a lot trickier than expected! Working out the puzzle took a fair while and have to admit to a couple of prompts here and there to get me to it. The walk to the cache was really nice if a touch iffy under foot in places. It took just over 2 hours in total. Managed to avoid the heavy rain showers, just!! Finding the cache itself in a heavenly little spot took a good "flat" search and a bit of stretching. The remote wilderness feel of the cache site area was very special. Thanks for a great cache!</li></ul></logs>
