  <long-description><p>The Balrothery Poor Law Union was formally declared on the 1st
April 1839 and covered an area of 120 square miles. Its operation
was overseen by an elected Board of Guardians, 23 in number,
representing its 12 electoral divisions as listed below (figures in
brackets indicate numbers of Guardians if more than one):</p>
<p>Co. Dublin: Balbriggan (3), Ballyboghill, Balscaddan,
Clonmethon, Donabate (2), Hollywood (2), Holmpatrick (2),
Kilsallaghan (2), Kinsealy [Kinsaley], Lusk (3), Malahide (2),
Swords (3).</p>
<p>The Board also included 7 ex-officio Guardians, making a total
of 30. The population falling within the Union at the 1831 census
had been 28,124 with Divisions ranging in size from Clonmethon
(population 890) to Balbriggan (5,078).</p>
<p>The new Balrothery Union workhouse was erected on a 24-acre site
about three miles to the north-west of Lusk. Designed by the Poor
Law Commissioners' architect George Wilkinson, the building
followed one of his standard designs to accommodate 400 inmates.
Its construction cost £4,945 plus £905 for fittings etc. The site
location and layout are shown on the 1909 OS map.</p>
<p>The workhouse was declared fit for the reception of paupers on
1st February, 1841, and received its first admissions on 15th
March.</p>
<p>During the famine in the mid 1840s, a 48-bed fever hospital was
erected at the east of the main building. Additional accommodation
was provided by erecting additional sleeping galleries and by
taking over the workhouse officers' accommodation. The workhouse
had a burial ground situated across the main road, a quarter of a
mile to the north-west of the workhouse.</p>
<p>During the First World War, the workhouse is believed to have
been used to house Belgian refugees.</p>
<p>The buildings at the above coordinates no longer exist except
for the derelict remains of a small part of the entrance block, and
the chapel, which was originally the central rear section of the
main building.</p>

<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p><b>The cache is not at the above coordinates</b></p>
<p>To find the cache you need to look for some simple clues but
beware there are a few possible numbers just to try and trip you up
:-)</p>
<p><b>Part One:</b> go to N53 31.986 W6 11.726</p>
<p>Nearby there are two letters using ABC = 123ect convert the
letters to numbers and call them <b>Y. Z</b></p>
<p><b>Part Two:</b> go to N53 31.977 W6 11.731 there you will see
an enlightened number call it <b>V.W</b></p>
<p><b>Final Location</b></p>
N53 <b>WV.9 (Zx3+V+W)</b> W006 <b>(9+W-V).(9-W+V)(9+Y+Z-W)</b>
