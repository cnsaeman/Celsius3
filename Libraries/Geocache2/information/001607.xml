The Leixlip Gate and Gate House are remainders of a long side road
leading up to Castletown House. It is not a well known or much
reported-on historical part of the Castletown Estate.
<p><b>The cache is a small size magnetic loc-box wrapped in a
black<br />
covering.</b></p>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

We had to kill some time, before heading to the airport; so we decided to look for some cache on the way.

Thanks for this one...
