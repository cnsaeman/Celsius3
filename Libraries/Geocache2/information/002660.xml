  <description>This cache is a small container, wrapped in black, up high but within arms reach. A short, easy walk, with a bit of an incline for the last few feet.</description>

#209</li><li>2010-02-23T20:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />Found this cache lying on the ground with no black bag covering it. We rehid the cache low down where it would not be so easily spotted. Log very damp & could do with some maintainance.

#209</li><li>2010-02-21T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Frezeluberz <br />Couldn't find it.
Didn't really spend a lot of time looking.
Think we found where it should have been.
Didn't investigate the ground.</li><li>2009-07-19T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Out for a day of caching with JME1979 - this was our third find for the day and my 300th overall. The heavens opened up as we were approaching 200m from the cache, by the time it was in hand we were drenched and trying unsuccessfully to get cover from the trees. Figuring that we were as wet as we could possibly get anyway we headed back to the car - and naturally it dried up as we got back.</li></ul></logs>
