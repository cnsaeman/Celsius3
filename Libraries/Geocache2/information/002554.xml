  <long-description><p align="left"><b>The Hill of Tara:</b></p>
<p align="left">The Hill of Tara was occupied long before the turn
of the millennium. One of the many mounds on the hill was excavated
and proved to be a Stone Age passage tomb dated to 2000BC.</p>
<p>When Tara first became a royal site, it was probably only host
to one king, but gradually the site gained in importance and was
recognised as the most powerful in the country.</p>
<p>The remains of the many monuments on the Hill of Tara show it to
have been a multi-period site and one of major importance. The
given names of the sites are not necessarily correct as they
originated from interpreted medieval texts.</p>
<br />
<br />
 
<p align="left"><b>The Principal Monuments:</b></p>
<p>The <b>Rath of the Synods</b> <i>(Rath na Seanadh)</i> has been
excavated. It is a very elaborate structure with four concentric
banks and ditches. It was used at different periods between the 2nd
and 4th centuries for habitation, ritual and burial. There was
evidence that the people who lived here had contacts with the Roman
Empire. Roman pottery, glass, seals and other material were
recovered.</p>
<p>The <b>Mound of the Hostages</b> <i>(Dumha na nGiall)</i> is a
Stone Age passage tomb. It was used many centuries later in the
Bronze Age when people of wealth and importance were buried in it.
The tomb stands inside a large circular enclosure called the
<b>Royal Enclosure</b> <i>(Rath na Roigh)</i>, which is a Hillfort.
This type of fortification is typical of the Iron Age and is
therefore a much later structure than the Mound of the Hostages. It
is defined by an earthen bank with a ditch inside.</p>
<p>Also in the Royal Enclosure are the <b>Royal Seat</b>
<i>(Forradh)</i> and <b>Cormac’s House</b> <i>(Teach Cormaic)</i>.
The Royal Seat is a Ringfort and Cormac’s House a Barrow, so-called
because of the mound inside a circular bank. Standing in Cormac’s
House is the <b>Stone Of Destiny</b> <i>(Lia Fail)</i>, said to be
the inauguration stone of the Kings of Tara.</p>
<p>To the south of the Royal Enclosure are the remains of the
<b>Enclosure of King Laoire</b> <i>(Rath Laoire)</i>, which is
another Hillfort.</p>
<p>The <b>Banquet Hall</b> <i>(Teach Miodhchuarta)</i> is a long
rectangular area. It is possible that roads converged on this point
and that this provided the entrance to Tara. It is incorrectly
called the Banquet Hall because it was so interpreted by medieval
texts.</p>
<p>The <b>Sloping Trenches</b> <i>(Claoin Fhearta)</i> and
<b>Grainne’s Enclosure</b> <i>(Rath Grainne)</i> are three circular
earthworks on the north west of the Hill of Tara. They are
recognised as Barrows.</p>
<br />
<br />
 The tour of the monuments may start at the Churchyard, where an
audio-visual presentation is also on offer. <br />

Patrick commemorates his legendary visit to the court of King
Laoire before he began on his mission to bring Christianity to
Ireland.</p>

<p align="left">The Cache is a small tablock box covered in black
cloth please take care when rehiding it:</p>
<br />
<p align="left">The Hill of Tara lies to the west of the N3
Dublin-Derry road, between Navan and Dunshaughlin. It is clearly
signposted.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-14T19:00:00Z : Found it by geowas <br />I came here more by coincidence than by plan when driving from Dublin to Donegal. Unfortuntely I failed with the multi - no clue what went wrong.

Thanks for a nice cache at an interesting historical site.

geowas</li><li>2010-06-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by Serapis <br />Some people like geocaching for various reasons but today was a classic example of what it does for me.

As I walked back out of the site (after finding the cache) a school tour was coming in, about twenty giddy fifth/sixth class girls. As I approached the group the head teacher stopped them and told them to turn around and look at the view. “The high kings of Ireland held their court here” she said, “You can see the amazing view across the land, here they could see all of their kingdom”. Immediately a hand shot up and asked, “Can we go and roll down the bank?” Without hesitation the teacher said, “Yes when we’re done”. A cheer went up and all were happy, and the teacher started babbling on again. I nearly hit the ground with the laughter and laughed most of the way back to Waterford thinking about it, the timing and delivery was perfect! You couldn’t have made this up, it was priceless  [:D] [:D] [:D]

Found the cache quickly, can’t wait to come back for the extensive nearby multi which I did not have time for today. The view from such a low hill is unnatural, its like a trick or optical illusion. It reminds me of the first time I saw Stonehenge in Wiltshire, strangely larger than life and positioned to be seen is a favourable aspect. TFTC, I’ve never visited Tara before even though I only come from 30 km down the road. A memorable visit.

Greetings from Germany - Bavaria</li><li>2010-05-20T19:00:00Z : Found it by Bibucha <br />Very beautiful place and view. Found during my first visit to Ireland with my sister. Greetings from Czech Republic :-) TFTC</li><li>2010-05-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by VMBC <br />so happy to finally find a cache with trade items in Europe [:)] --- of course we had given up on finding anything other than micros so we left our swag at the guest house [:I] TFTF</li><li>2008-08-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Find #179
We had a walk around the area, spending most of the time dodging sheep deposits. Definitely a better view from the air but still pretty cool. After a while we decided it was time to move on to the cache which Juli managed to find within a few seconds. Removed the battery (will dispose of that properly) and the staples. Left a couple of badges as it was all we had on hand. 
Found with Christian, Juli and Flo (who are visiting from Germany) - TFTC</li></ul></logs>
