Like most of the Liffey Bridges this is a magnetic micro. You will
need to bring a pen or pencil with you. It can be found without
precise coordinates but if you require better information then
solve the following:<br />
<br />
How many lamposts are there on the bridge? Call the answer "A". The
final coordinates are N53 20.726 W006 16.(268 X A)<br />
PLEASE REPLACE CAREFULLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER NAD MAKE SURE IT IS
CLOSED PROPERLY. PLEASE ALSO REPLACE EXACTLY WHERE YOU FOUND IT.

 Fr Matthew Bridge is a road bridge spanning the River Liffey in
and joining Merchants Quay to Church Street and the north
quays.<br />
The site of Fr Matthew Bridge is understood to be close to the
ancient "Ford of the Hurdles", which was the original crossing
point on the Liffey and gives its name (in Irish) to the city of
Dublin.<br />
At the turn of the first millennium (c.1014), the first recorded
Dublin Liffey bridge was built at this point. Possibly known as the
Bridge of Dubhghall, this basic wooden structure was maintained and
rebuilt over several centuries (from early Medieval to Viking to
Norman times)<br />
. In 1428, the Dominicans of Ostmantown Friary built the first
masonry bridge in Dublin, at this point. Known as Dublin Bridge,
Old Bridge, or simply The Bridge, this four arch structure had
towers at either end, and shops, housing, an inn and a chapel were
built on its supports.<br />
For much of its 390-year life span, The Bridge carried all
pedestrian, livestock and horse-drawn traffic across the river, and
(as late as 1762) its tolls and chapel were still in use.<br />
At the beginning of the 19th century, Dublin Bridge was replaced by
a three-span, elliptical arch stone bridge. Designed by George
Knowles (who also architected O'Donovan Rossa Bridge and Lucan
Bridge), the bridge was opened in 1818 as Whitworth Bridge, for
Charles, Earl of Whitworth, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.<br />
As with many other Dublin bridges (particularly those named for
British peers), the bridge was renamed following independence by
the Free State as Dublin Bridge in 1923.<br />
In line with another Dublin tradition of naming bridges for
temperance campaigners, the bridge was renamed again in 1938 for
Father Theobald Mathew (the Apostle of Temperance) who was born at
Thomastown near Golden, County Tipperary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Four Courts building nearby<br />
One of the landmarks of Dublin with its large drum and shallow
dome, and visible all along the Liffey, the Four Courts derives its
names from the four divisions that traditionally were the judicial
system in Ireland. These were: Chancery, King's Bench, Exchequer,
and Common Pleas. Architect: James Gandon.<br />
Interior Access Court Hours Only.<br />
The Four Courts figured prominently in the film Michael Collins
where it was considerably "damaged" from artillery fire. <br />
Originally, part of the building was designed by Thomas Cooley with
a revised later scheme being developed by James Gandon to
incorporate the earlier work. The original plan of the western
block designed by Thomas Cooley consisted of a number of separate
'houses', each with its own entrance and stairwell. The eastern
block designed by Gandon was one building with complete internal
access. This can be seen on the plan below with Cooley's block on
the left.<br />
The building's main feature is the dome and main portico. The
portico and pediment are a shallow projection from the centre block
but Gandon created a semi-circular recess under the pediment
bringing the entrance into the building. <br />
The interior of the Four Courts was reconstructed after the Civil
War and the interior rearranged. The central rotunda above is as
Gandon designed it with the four main courtrooms opening off it
diagonally. This dramatic public space soars up into the drum
creating a sombre and awe inspiring venue for the administration of
the law.<br />
<br />
You will also note two of Dublin's most popular pubs, particularly
with foreign tourists, on the south side of the bridge. These are
O'Seas The Merchant and The Brazen Head. Each are famous for Irish
traditional music.<br />
<br />
The Old Jameson Distillery is a very short walk from this bridge
and daily tours are available.</long-description>
