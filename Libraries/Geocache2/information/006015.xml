  <long-description><p align="justify">Around 1770 on the coast of Blackrock a house
was built with fine rococo features in mini-demesne with a large
garden. The owner was Nicholas Lawless, Lord Cloncurry. When the
Railway company started to build the railway line in 1830s, Lord
Cloncurry of Maretimo and Sir Harcourt Lees of Blackrock House (the
Blackrock House was nearby) declined to build a railway line
through their lands. Finally, the Railway company gave them large
compensation, private harbor, and few buildings, which were built
for them. It was the Cloncurry Towers bridge, granite bridge over
the railway and doric bathing-temple. Towers and bridge still
exist, but bathing-temple was demolished in 2004. Now you can find
ruins of this structure, and broken pillars on the bottom of the
sea nearby. Maretimo house was demolished in 1970’s.<br />
<br />
 Unfortunately, there is no easy access to Maretimo grounds. There
is one small footbridge, but is accessible only for residents
Maretimo housing estate. Anyway, there are two other ways. One
route starts nearby Blacrock DART station at coordinates N53 18.140
W6 10.651 where there is a car park too, and the second route at
coordinates N53 17.888 W6 09.625 on a small harbor in Seapoint
(where you can find parking space as well), not far from DART
station. Both ways require walking on the sea-shore, and <b>you
have to come during the low tide.</b> You can check tides

<br />
 The cache is small tupperware container with some goodies. Be
careful, because sometimes this area can be muggled, especially at
sunny weekends.</p>

TFTC.</li><li>2010-06-12T19:00:00Z : Found it by colmyster <br />Where do I start with this one. Firstly we came at it from the north so we had to scale alot of walls and rocks which is not recommended. Then when we finally got to the cache we tried to get back to the road from the oppisite direction but we came across a couple who where, well, lets just say they where having a very active romantic evening !! So back over the dangerous rocks it was for us....
