  <long-description><p><b>Swords Round Tower</b></p>
<p>Swords Round Tower has a conical cap and stands about 26m high.
The upper 5m of the tower appear to have been rebuilt. Here there
are four very large windows facing the cardinal points. The
stonework in this area is rough and crude and totally unlike the
stonework lower down. The doorway is 1.66m high and less than 1m
above present ground level.</p>
<p>In the 10th Century the Round Tower was used as a look-out post
and housed the bloody remains of King Brian Boru and his son
Murrough after the famous Battle of Clontarf on their way to be
buried in Armagh. During the course of the decisive battle the
Irish king’s army had routed the Viking invaders and at one point
captured their flag. The black raven featured on the flag remains
the symbol of Fingal today. Indeed the area gets its name from the
Viking words ‘Fionn Gall', meaning 'land of the fair haired
stranger', the term for Vikings who had settled in the area from
the 8th Century onwards. After the battle many of the defeated
Vikings remained on as residents in the area enriching the local
Gaelic traditions with their own indigenous crafts such as wood
carving and turning, wrought iron working, pottery, sculpting and
garment design. The tower gives an unrivaled view of Fingal as far
as the Mountains of Mourne on a clear day. John Sweetman, the
United Irishman and friend of Wolfe Tone, was buried in the shadow
of the two towers.</p>
<p>The square belfry, standing 6 meters to the southeast of the
round tower was most likely built in the 14th century. The ground
at a corner of this belfry is at the same level as the ground at
the base of the round tower. The floor level of the belfry is said
to be 1.6 meters lower than this, indicating that the ground level
has been raised significantly and that the doorway of the round
tower may have been closer to 2 meters above ground level when it
was built.</p>
<p>The cross on top the tower was reputedly placed there by the
Rev. Henry Scardeville, vicar from 1682 - 1704. Early drawings show
it complete, much as it is today. References were made to repairs
to the top in 1775, but no further details were given as to what
kind of repairs took place. Floors and ladders were placed in 1832,
but the ladders were unusable by 1877.</p>
