<br />
<br />
<p>It comprises now of the townlands of Abbotstown, Annfield,
Ashtown, Astagob, Blanchardstown, Cabragh (i.e., the bad land),
Cappoge (originally Keppok), Carpenterstown, Castleknock, Corduff
(i.e., the black hill), Deanestown, Diswellstown, Dunsink,
Huntstown, Johnstown, Mitchelstown, Pelletstown, Porterstown,
Scribblestown (i.e., the rough land), Sheephill, Snugborough. These
names are largely derived from those of former occupants of the
lands, viz., the families of Abbot, Blanchard, Carpenter, Deuswell,
Hunt, Mitchel, Pilate, and Porter.</p>
<br />
<p><b>The cache</b> is located on the playing fields of Porterstown
Park. It is a small cylinder box with log, writing instrument and
some cache goodies.</p>
<br />
<p>The coordinates above will bring you to a car park. You will
need to work out the final co-ordinates by answering the following
questions and working out the following math.</p>
<br />
<p>A famous resident of Porterstown was John Thomas Troy who was
born at Annefield House, Porterstown, Dublin in 1739. He came from
a 'well to do' family with his father owning lands in Porterstown
and Kellytown. He was one of four boys and three girls.</p>
<br />
<center><img src=
"http://www.dublindiocese.ie/images/stories/archives/troy.jpg" /></center>
<br />
<br />
<p>Question 1 - Which boy was he? : first, second, third or
fourth?</p>
<p>Call the answer A.</p>
<br />
<p>At a young age he joined the Dominican Order in Dublin. Six
months later he was sent to study at San Clemente, Rome. He
remained there for twenty-one years.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Question 2 - What age did he join the Dominican Order?</p>
<p>Call the answer B and C.</p>
<br />
<p>In 1776 he was appointed Bishop of Ossory and in 1786 he was
appointed Archbishop of Dublin and served in Dublin for 37
years.</p>
<br />
<p>Question 3 - Upon whose death did Bishop Troy replace as
Archbishop of Dublin?</p>
<p>Count the number of letters in this person surname and call the
answer D.</p>
<br />
<p>Troy's last big achievement was the building of the
Pro-Cathedral. The site at Marlborough Street was purchased in 1803
but progress was exceptionally slow. The foundation stone was
finally laid by Daniel Murray in 1815 but by 1821 it remained
unfinished and funds were exhausted.</p>
<br />
<center><img src=

<br />
Archbishop Troy continued with his work, including fund-raising to
finish the cathedral, up the time of his death. His obsequies took
place there in the year of his death however he was not laid to
rest in the cathedral vaults until 1824.<br />
<p>Question 4 - What year did he die?</p>
<p>Add the numbers of the year and call the answer E and F.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Now to find the final coordinates do the following math:</p>
<br />
N&nbsp;= &nbsp;53.(F*C-A-B}.(A-B) &nbsp; (F+E+B-C) &nbsp; {(C+F)
&nbsp; -&nbsp; (D+A)} &nbsp;<br />
<p>W = 006.24.A (F-E) D</p>
