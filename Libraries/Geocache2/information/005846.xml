  <long-description>A small piece of suburban wilderness sandwiched between the Rock
Road and the DART - it's the last remnant of un-reclaimed shoreline
in South County Dublin and a haven for birds and plants, including
a rare grass - Puccinellia Fasciculata, which was threatened by an
invasive rush. The situation was saved by removing a sluice gate
put in place in 1914 - now the tide washes in and out twice a day,
flushing in much needed oxygen and killing off the invasive rush.</long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

On our way back to Dublin, we did a quick stop. I liked this little park.

Thanks for this one...

A friendly butterfly joined us for a while.</li><li>2007-08-23T07:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Kersti.com <br />GPS was pretty adamant that this is the spot and reading the logs, so am I - however, the pain was too much and we decided to move on to easier pickings.</li></ul></logs>
