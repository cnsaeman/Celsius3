  <description>A pleasant tour of Shanganagh Park - Shankill's first cache. Enjoy!</description>
  <long-description>The Park

Shanganagh Park in Shankill was formerly known as Tyrell's land, and is about 42 hectares in extent. The major portion, consisting of about 40 hectares, was acquired specifically for public open space in 1982.

The main railway divides Shanganagh Park in half. A pedestrian bridge was installed jointly by Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and larnrod Eireann in 1995-1996 to improve access.

The Park provides a range of recreational activities including playing pitches, an adventure style playground, a Trim Trail, woodland and coastal walks.

The public open space at Quinn's Road is home to Shankill Tennis Club and Shankill Bowling Club.

The Park is open year round from dawn until dusk.

For more information on Shanganagh Park please visit the Dun Laoighre Rathdown County Council website at: www.dlrcoco.ie/parks

Public Transport: Shankill DART Station is apx 10 - 12 min walk from the park main entrance.  Dublin Bus No. 45 travels from Merrion Square to Bray and has a stop at the park entrance.


The Cache

To find the cache you will need to visit a number of locations, all of which are inside Shanganagh Park.

Stage One: N53° 13.322, W006° 07.273
At this location, you should take a look at the Map on the Park Information Board to familiarise yourself with the park layout. Nearby, how many seagulls can the dolphin see? Call this A.

Stage Two: N53° 13.474, W006° 06.971
At Fitness Step 13 on the Trim Trail, how many rungs do you count? Call this B.

Stage Three: N53° 13.656, W006° 06.875
How many net supporting poles surround the Home Plate at the Baseball Field? Call this C.

Stage Four: N53° 13.701, W006° 06.736
Point 4 on the notice board at the Dog Park defines an adult as D years or older.

Stage Five: N53° 13.818, W006° 06.543
At the Quinn’s Road entrance there is a sign – the year mentioned on the second line of the first paragraph is EFGH.

You now have all the clues you need to find the cache, which is at:

N 53° [E] [square root of F] . [H] [F-G] [C]
W 6° [C-G] [D-10] . [square root of (D+F)] [A squared] [B-F]

Took us two goes to get this. Had the coords right but just didn't believe them (or at least assumed the cache would be somewhere else). Found a hoard of golf balls but no cache. Eventually decided to trust the coords and sure enough it was pretty much there. Got a quick email from Windsockers that put us right too. Again thanks enjoyed this one.
</li><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />The logbook is lovely! Thanks for putting thought and care into decorating the logbook - it made the cache memorable and a little bit special, and made me smile when I opened it!

This cache is very "local" for me. Although I live in Sandyford now, I grew up in Shankill and often go for walks with my dog through Shanganagh Park and down onto the beach when I'm in the area to visit my dad. So I was delighted to see a cache published there. Yesterday (Saturday) morning my wife and I visited the first two stages before we ran out of time and had to leave. Then this afternoon on the way back from the Sugarloaf I came back to finish this cache. Nice tour of the park, and straight to the final co-ordinates. At first I couldn't believe the co-ordinates were right, but a little poking around revealed a nicely hidden cache. Back to the car just as it started to rain heavily; very nice timing. Thanks for an enjoyable caching experience!</li></ul></logs>
