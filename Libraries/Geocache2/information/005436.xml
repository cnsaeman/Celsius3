<br />
A walk in the garden county on low level hills with moderate hiking
and some rough sections including fences. A round trip of two to
two and a half hours should complete this one as much of the
walking is on forest roads. There are boggy sections and one
moderate ascent and it should be NOTED that there are some fences
to be crossed (one or two have stiles and others don't). The total
distance is nine and a half Kilometres with a total ascent of only
342 metres.<br />
There is a megalithic tomb about half way between Lugnagun and
Sorrel which you pass twice but I was unable to locate it during my
treks.<br />
To get to the summit of Lugnagun climb up along the edge of the
wood on some rough ground, overlooking the area where the 1798 men
and women had their camp. These rebels were under the command of
the Dublin lawyer Colonel McMahon and they mainly came from
Kildare, Dublin and Wicklow.<br />
According to my map, (taken from East West Mapping) Wat Read,
presumably a rebel leader, was hanged near the summit of Lugnagun
but again I was unable to unearth any detailed information about
him.<br />
This camp was later joined by the experienced commander from
Roundwood, (General) Joseph Holt. The camp was then moved from
there to the more elevated and rugged Whelp Rock area near Black
Hill.<br />
<br />
The cache is placed a modest distance above Ballynultagh car park
where you should finish.<br />
***NOTE: It is perfectly possible to do this hiking cache AND its
neighbouring one on Black Hill in the one trip using the same car
park to start and finish.<br />
You may require a pen and paper. To find this cache you will need
to start a little distance down the road at N53 08.475 W006 27.655
and head for Stage 1 at N53 08.680 W006 28.178. There is a fork in
the track shortly after the start. You should stay left at this.
Reaching Stage 1 you will find a thick fence post and 2 numbers.
Call these in ascending order AB.<br />
<br />
Turn North uphill to Ref. 1 at N53 08.711 W006 28.150 where you
will find a gate behind which is a black and yellow barrier. Climb
over and head up the forest track to the right till you reach Ref 2
at N53 08.900 W006 28.701. Here the forest road splits but you can
take either one to reach Stage 2. My advice is to take the left one
as the distance is the same but the views along the lake are quite
stunning in nice weather on that side. If you take this option you
will need to keep right at Ref 3 at N53 08.887 W006 29.091.<br />
<br />
To access Stage 2, as advised above, you will need to cross rough
ground (leaving the forest track at N53 09.247 W006 29.656 where
the forest has been cut and head toward the summit of Lugnagun
following close to the fence along the wood. When I did this hike
last there were a number of trees down but it was easy work to get
around them. Stay in the forest until you reach Stage 2.<br />
Stage 2 is at N53 09.298 W006 29.414.<br />
<br />
Here you will find 2 more numbers (one post to the lake side of the
corner post!. Call these, in ascending order CD.<br />
From there exit the wood and then you will need to walk along the
forest edge Eastward in the direction of Sorrel which you should be
able to see in the distance and reaching Stage 3 along the way.
This route is rough hiking with several fences some of which have
stiles.<br />
Look for the corner edge of the forest.<br />
<br />
Stage 3 is at N53 08.814 W006 28.060<br />
<br />
Here you will find 3 more numbers. Call these, in ascending order
FGE as they appear.<br />
Follow the bog path up the hill to Sorrel summit and find Stage
4<br />
<br />
Stage 4 is at N53 08.871 W006 26.607<br />
Find 3 more numbers here and call them, in ascending order
HJI.<br />
<br />
Final Cache: N53 AB.CDE W006 FG.HIJ<br />
<br />
There is a narrow bog track down to the cache and the car park at
Ballynultagh from the summit of Sorrel Hill. While at the cairn on
top look SE about 50 metres away where there is a peat hag ridge
with a small but clear gap. Follow this winding route down as it is
by far the easiest way to the cache and the road.<br />

Piece from Mountain Views about Sorrel Hill.<br />
"In Irish, I have seen this hill referred to as &lsquo;Cor
tSamhaidh&rsquo;, the Round Hill of the Sorrel. The sorrel in
question is obviously the plant of that name, called
&lsquo;samhadh&rsquo; in Irish (&lsquo;Rumex acetosa&rsquo; in
botany). It is the long-leaved common sorrel that often ends up in
our salads. One would therefore expect an abundance of the plant
here, if it did give its name to the hill, yet I have so far never
found a specimen. Then again, I have never gone out avidly looking
for one, either. Leaving this botanical conundrum aside, the most
notable feature on Sorrel is the megalithic cairn on its summit,
which has a diameter of about 20m. (Enterprising modern hands have
added a further small cairn to the original beneath.) Just to the
left of the mound, can be seen in the distance the cluster of
Seefin, Seefingan and Seahan, equally crowned with megaliths. These
hills lie between 6 and 8kms away, across the valley of the Liffey.
There are other remnants of the past in the immediate vicinity,
too, though they are difficult to find. On the broad saddle between
Sorrel and Lugnagun there are, reportedly, traces of several Stone
Age enclosures (detectable in aerial photography) and another cairn
about 10m in diameter, but I have looked for them in vain in this
very broken terrain. A little further on, inside the forest fence,
there is a small megalithic tomb (marked, this time, on the OSI
map), but now so hemmed in by forest that it is in danger of being
totally engulfed (Coillte protecting our heritage!). One thing our
megalithic forebears did not see from the top of Sorrel is, of
course, the 11 kilometre long Pollaphuca Reservoir to the west.
Although we know today that there was, in fact, a lake there
between 15,000 and 10,000 years ago, fed by meltwater from a
glacier, it had long disappeared before the builders of the
megaliths ever came upon the scene. The dam that forms the present
lake, dating from 1940, has given us a view of the past that makes
even Stone Age man a recent blow-in by comparison".</long-description>
