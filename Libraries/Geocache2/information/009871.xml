  <description>This is a tourist cache ie, it can be reached using public transport - The DART - from the centre of Dublin. I have rated it using the Geocache system, the rating would be less if approached by car.</description>
  <long-description>Take the DART from Tara Street (nearest to city centre) to Howth station. Turn left (East) as you exit the station and head for Mc Guirk's golf shop. Turn right up Abbey St and head up the hill passing to the right of the church. Keep going until you turn right up Wingate Road. You are now looking for waypoint N 53째 11.122 W 006째 04.122 you should be exactly two miles from Howth Station. Go through the gate and take the path to the cache - let your GPS do the rest!
<P>
It is possible to park your car near the above waypoint.
<P>
The cache is in a tupperware container inside a green plastic bag and contains a camera, Geocaching key ring, pack of crayons, measuring tape etc.
<P>
The view of the city and the bay make this a worthwhile trip, good luck and a "Happy New Year fellow Geocachers" </long-description>
  <encoded-hints>Gloves would be useful as the cache is hidden in prickly gorse!</encoded-hints>

#339</li><li>2008-11-09T20:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Out with Gavin and Anton today. Approached from Aideen's Grave which was a round-about way and quite soggy.

Soon got to the spot where we had to kind of make our own path through the prickly bushes - not so bad as we all had sturdy shoes and jeans on, but wouldn't want to lose my footing!

Cache itself is quite badly in need of maintenance, log book is full but I managed to squeeze a sticker on the last page there.

Fabulous views too, and the pub of the same name was welcome respite from the cold and rain.</li><li>2008-11-09T18:50:03Z : Needs Maintenance by Kersti.com <br />Hi, cache lid is broken, log book is chockers full and the contents are a bit icky and quite damp.</li></ul></logs>
