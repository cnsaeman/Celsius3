  <long-description><center>This is the last of three multicache based around the Slí
na Sláinte routes in Swords. This one follows the River Valley Park
variation of the Highfield Slí. The walks are circular routes to be
walked in either direction from any starting point.</center>

<center>Similarly, this cache can be started from any waypoint in
any order. Find the required information at each waypoint, work out
the final coordinates and find the cache. The cache is most easily
done on foot or by bike as most of the stages and the final
location are within the park. This Slí is about 4.5k long. The
cache only follows part of the trail. Start to finish this cache
covers a distance of about 2k; you'll have to make your own way
back.</center>

Nice walk on both occasions, and I had great weather for it. </li><li>2009-12-28T20:00:00Z : Found it by theswerve <br />Bit of a longer walk this...bit of crunching of maths but got there after hint from owner...TFTC...</li><li>2009-12-10T20:00:00Z : Found it by toczygroszek <br />How can I miss this one last time?? I'm pretty sure I was looking at that place where I found cache now, must be magical container [:D]
And I think that is 2nd cache in Swords area where description mentioned about troll - it looks this town must be full of these creatures. Beware of trolls! :bad:
Really thanks for walk in nice area</li><li>2009-12-07T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by toczygroszek <br />I think I figured out coordinates correct, and place was pretty obvious, but spent too much time looking for "Slí Slán Amhain", and arrived there at darkness. Want sure about coordinates, so just checked most obvious place but didn't find there cache... [:(]

Very bad geocaching day :sad:</li><li>2009-12-07T20:00:00Z : Found it by Hezekiah <br />Found easily - great day for a walkabout!  TFTC!</li></ul></logs>
