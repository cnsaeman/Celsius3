Difficult to find the object in the hint once you open your eyes and you're surrounded by them.</li><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />This was a great one to do with the kids as they loved running from one piece of equipment to the next.

Out: Golfball and marble
In: 2 marbles</li><li>2010-04-11T19:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />Found this cache after a lovely walk around the park.
It was a lovely sunny day & lots of people out. Maybe summer is coming.
