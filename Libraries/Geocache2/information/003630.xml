  <long-description><p>One of a series of caches along the Dodder River – the paths
linking these caches is wheelchair and buggy/pram passable, unless
otherwise stated. All the caches in this series are also accessible
to the wheelchair user, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>This one is a micro-cache <b>(bring a pen/pencil to sign the
log!)</b> hidden near St. Anne’s – a former secondary school and
convent. The school is now closed and most of the lands have been
sold for development – apartments and houses. The cache is
accessible by, and from, wheelchair – car park is at N 53 18.677 W
006 14.836. You could also park at N 53 18.475 W 006 15.338 and
take in the “Dodder – Dropping Well” cache and the “Dodder – Dartry
Park” cache.</p>
