  <description>Located on the northside of the Surgarloaf mountain (501m). The cache is facing War hill mountain. This cache isn't hidden on the summit, it's hidden on the smaller summit (300m) closest to the R755 which leads to Glendalough and Roundwood.</description>
  <long-description>The cache location has a beautiful view of the Wicklow mountains War hill and Djouce etc. Its very rocky and there's a lot of gorse. The cache is roughly 300m high.</long-description>
