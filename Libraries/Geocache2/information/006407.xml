  <long-description><b>Rogerstown estuary</b> 
<p>is situated about 2 km north of Donabate in north County Dublin.
It is a relatively small, funnel shaped estuary separated from the
sea by a sand and shingle peninsula and extending eastwards beyond
the low water mark to include an area of shallow marine water. The
estuary receives the waters of the Ballyboghil and Ballough rivers,
both of which flow through intensive agricultural catchments. The
estuary has a wide salinity range, from near full sea water to near
full fresh water. The estuary is divided by a causeway and narrow
bridge, built in the 1840s to carry the Dublin-Belfast railway
line. The site contains good examples of a number of estuarine and
coastal habitat. It is an internationally renowned wildlife
sanctuary, popular with bird watchers and walkers in wellies!</p>
<p><b>Access to the grounds is between from 8am to 8pm</b></p>
<p>There might be plenty of muggles about on Saturdays and Sundays
so please take care when re hiding the cache.</p>
<p><b>Please note: there are no vehicles permitted beyond the
allotments, you will need to walk to the cache location from there,
all the roadways are privately owned beyond this point.</b></p>
<p><b>Getting there</b></p>
<p>The entrance to the Rogerstown Estuary is sign posted on the
R126 just before The Golf Club at N 53° 29.512 W 006° 10.789</p>
<p>If you want to visit this cache using public transport, the bus
route to take from Dublin City centre is the No. 33 Alternatively,
you can take the 41 from Dublin City Centre to Swords, and then
take the 33A (which from Swords on follows the same route as the
33).</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The cache is a small tablock box with the usual goodies</p>
<p>To find the cache go to the co-ords above there you will see
some photographs of birds that can be seen on the estuary.<br />
 Count the Number of photographs This will be <b>A.B</b> Count the
number of birds in the photographs on the bottom row This will be
<b>C</b></p>
<p>Then add <b>A+C</b> = <b>D</b> Then add <b>A+A</b> = <b>E</b>
Then add <b>A+B</b> = <b>F</b></p>

Found without any difficulty or interruption from the birdwatchers who were busy doing their thing.

Tftc</li><li>2009-09-27T19:00:00Z : Found it by mr-frog <br />We loved this Cache!! We had a lovely walk, and ate lots of blackberries. Lenny ate the most. There are a couple of ways to attck this cache. I think we took the easiest way, but I can see how many end up having to jump across streams etc. It took a little while to find once we reached the co-ordinates as the brambles were out in full force, but well worth the wait. Lots of strange noises coming from the wildlife and the golfers
IN: Lennys prized spinning top that lights up!
OUT: a super dooper pen/stamper.

Thanks for the Cache Mr Windsocker!</li><li>2008-08-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by theswerve <br />Yes..there defo is a right way to do this one..went along seaside straight to 0..but got within 8mtrs and found myself with a ditch,bit wide to jump,,so back tracked and went the right way... </li><li>2008-07-14T19:00:00Z : Found it by brackyboggers <br />Set off from gates at allottment. Lovely walk from here - poppies and cornflowers just beautiful! Not a muggle in sight so took our time (realised later this was a mistake) and enjoyed the walk to the cache. Found easily and set off back to find the gate man was about to lock us in...should read times on boards in future.
