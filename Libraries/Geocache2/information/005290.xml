 "Oh a hungry feeling,<br />
 came o'er me stealing<br />
 And the mice they were squealing<br />
 in my prison cell<br />
 Then that auld triangle,<br />
 went jingle jangle<br />
 All along the banks of the Royal Canal!"<br />
<br />
To begin the morning,<br />
 the screw was bawling<br />
 Get up you bowsie,<br />
 and clean up your cell<br />
 Then that auld triangle,<br />
 went jingle jangle<br />
 All along the banks of the Royal Canal<br />
 <br />
Oh the screw was peeping<br />
 and the lag lay sleeping<br />
 Dreamin` about his girl Sal<br />
 And that auld triangle,<br />
 went jingle jangle<br />
 All along the banks of the Royal Canal <br />
<br />
In the female prison<br />
 there are seventy women<br />
 And among them I wish<br />
I did dwell<br />
 And that auld triangle,<br />
 could go jingle jangle<br />
All along the banks of the Royal Canal<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The above coordinates should take you to see Dublin
writer/playright Brendan Behan sitting with a feathered friend
along the bank of the Royal Canal. To find the micro magnetic cache
look at the plaque and find the date that the "Canal Watch was
founded. In that date a figure appears twice. Use that as
"A".<br />
About 7/8 paces behind Brendan there is a pole with a number in
black on yellow. Use this number as "BC". <br />
The final coordinates are N53 21.6A6 W006 15.5(50+BC)<br />
<br />
<br />
The towpath along the canal is now designated “The Royal Canal
Way”. It is possible to walk from the 1st Dock in the centre of
Dublin to the 40th lock and is being cleared further as restoration
proceeds towards the Shannon and Longford. Signposts have been
erected at each bridge between Clonsilla and Mullingar. Eventually
these will be extended to cover the entire length of the
canal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Behan, the writer <br />
Behan's prison experiences were central to his future writing
career. In Mountjoy he wrote his first play, The Landlady and also
began to write short stories and other prose. Some of this work was
published in The Bell, the leading Irish literary magazine of the
time. He also learned Irish in prison and after his release in
1946, he spent some time in the Gaeltacht areas of Galway and
Kerry, where he started writing poetry in Irish. By the early 1950s
he was earning a living as a writer for radio and newspapers and
had gained a reputation as something of a character on the streets
and in literary circles in Dublin. <br />
His major breakthrough came in 1954 when his play The Quare Fellow,
which was based on his experiences in jail, was produced in the
Pike Theatre in Dublin. The play ran for six months. In May 1956,
The Quare Fellow opened in the Theatre Royal, Stratford, in a
production by Joan Littlewood, bringing international fame to the
author. <br />
In 1957, his Irish language play, An Giall (The Hostage) opened in
the Damer Theatre, and his autobiographical novel Borstal Boy was
published. Behan was now established as one of the leading Irish
writers of his generation. <br />
Behan was perhaps the most famous Irish writer of his time, and was
once hired to write an advertising slogan for Guinness. As part of
his payment for this, the company offered him half a dozen kegs of
their stout. After a month the company asked Behan what he had come
up with; Behan had already managed to drink all of the beer they
had given him and produced the slogan Guinness Makes You Drunk.
Erroneously, he is also sometimes credited with "Guinness is Good
for You", which was actually written by Dorothy L. Sayers. The
Royal Canal This cache is part of a series placed along the Royal
Canal Way. The series follows the towpaths along the Royal Canal
heading westwards towards the Shannon River. There are a number of
caches in the Dublin region stretching from the city centre out
into the country. Except for the first two centre city caches all
of these, and any clues or hints take you in the direction against
the water flow. To get the full benefit of this series I would
suggest that it is best done on foot or on a bicycle though most of
the caches may also be accessed by car. I have to say that the car
option will take considerable time, petrol and nausea inducing
traffic frustration not to mention considerable difficulty with
parking. During winter or wet conditions hiking boots or good
waterproof shoes will be required as the canal towpath can become
very sloppy and almost impossible in one or two spots. ""BE AWARE
OF THE DANGER AND THE SLIPPY MUD CLOSE TO THE WATER AT ALL TIMES
PLEASE"" There area number of Sidetrack caches at the railway
stations along the canal walk. A small detour at these points will
bring you to each one.</long-description>
