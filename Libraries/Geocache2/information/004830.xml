<center><b><i>In spring of youth it was my lot<br />
To haunt of the wide world a spot<br />
The which I could not love the less-<br />
So lovely was the loneliness<br />
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,<br />
And the tall pines that towered around.<br />
<br />
But when the Night had thrown her pall<br />
Upon that spot, as upon all,<br />
And the mystic wind went by<br />
Murmuring in melody-<br />
Then- ah then I would awake<br />
To the terror of the lone lake.<br />
<br />
Yet that terror was not fright,<br />
But a tremulous delight-<br />
A feeling not the jewelled mine<br />
Could teach or bribe me to define-<br />
Nor Love- although the Love were thine.<br />
<br />
Death was in that poisonous wave,<br />
And in its gulf a fitting grave<br />
For him who thence could solace bring<br />
To his lone imagining-<br />
Whose solitary soul could make<br />
An Eden of that dim lake.<br />

For me, this is one of the most visually stunning walks in the
Garden series. It is approx 11K in length with a total ascent of
about 850m if you follow the hike as described in the illustration
above. Naturally there are other ways to reach the cache but I
simply wanted to indicate one of the most rewarding walks you could
do in the beautiful Garden County and take in a few caches on the
way. The three and a half stars for terrain reflects the route in
the illustration above. It would be much less otherwise.<br />
It is a walk of two lakes and two mountains with much to see along
the way. From both summits, and from Knocknacloghogh in particular,
on a clear day you can see just about every summit in the Wicklow
mountains. You can meet large herds of deer both on the mountains
and in the grazing fields below. I preferred to do the hike in an
anti-clockwise direction and though the haul up to Fancy (Luggala)
is long, the second mountain is much easier. This cache is placed
in the pretty and often suntrapped valley between the two. I placed
it, near to the babbling brook, on the date of a significant
birthday where a group and I celebrated with a cake and a large
bottle of bubbly in glorious March sunshine!<br />
<br />
Stage 1 is at the Pier Gates at N53 05.785 W006 15.072 where you
will find a sign. Under the "Private Road" in the English section
count the words in the first short paragraph and call this number
"X"<br />
<br />
The position of the final cache is as follows: N53 05.(X times
37)+7 W006 17.27 times X<br />

Fuinnse [PNCW], 'ash-tree', and Cloghoge. Price's interpretation of
this name as Log an L&aacute;gh, 'hollow of the hill', is doubtful.
There is no evidence in dictionaries for the existence of a word
l&aacute;gh with this meaning. The second element does not appear
to be l&aacute;, 'day', either. Luggala is the 286th highest summit

  <logs><ul><li>2010-04-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Finished work at 1 so decided to head for the hills and see if I could pick this one up.

It really was the perfect day for such a stunning walk....just me and the hundreds of deer that graze in the area. I didn't realise it was still unfound until I got to gz and had to unwrap a shiny new log book!

I was hoping that the owner may have left some of that bubbly but sadly I had to settle for some of my own Tipperary Spring water instead [:)]

Thanks for another great cache and a belated happy birthday Sean!
