  <long-description>An International Cache exchange

An International Cache Exchange is where two people from two different countries agree to exchange caches. Then, you maintain the cache in your country & the other person maintains the cache in their country. When supplies get low, you replenish your cache in the other country & your counterpart replenishes the cache in your country.

The Cache

The cache is a Nano and should be an easy find.  Look before feel...you don't want to drop it here!  This cache has been hidden here with the consent and support of the staff.  You don't have to pay to get in.  If asked at the gate, tell them you are going to the hotel or the Powerscourt Gardens.  The gardens are beautiful and should not be missed.

Cache Maintenance

We wish to express or thanks and gratitude to Windsockers who has agreed to watch over and maintain this cache.</long-description>

Shame about the conversations we had to listen to from below. Like listening to the Magnum ad while walking in the woods.
Enjoyed it.
