  <long-description><p>The existing landfill at Balleally has been in operation since
1971. Balleally is currently the largest landfill in the Dublin
Region, accepting all waste generated within Fingal County Council
and those wastes from Dublin Corporation and South Dublin County
Council.<br />
The old landfill was designed on a "dilute and disperse" principle
with no leachate containment measures put in place which is typical
of landfills of this age in this country.</p>
<p>The site is due to close in 2010/11 and there are plans to turn
the area into a park.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The cache is a small decon box please rehide it well to prevent
muggles from discovering its location.<br />
To find the cache goto the above coords and take note of the year
call this ABCD also take note of the nearby two digit number call
this EF<br />
The cache can be found at N53 30.(A+E)(B-E)(B-C)W6 07.C(B-A)A</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-04T19:00:00Z : Found it by Wilddrude <br />This was the last day of our vacation in Ireland and also the very last cache.
A really nice country with lots of nice caches around and even more friendly people.

Thanks for the cache and greetings from Germany,

Our last find of a great days caching [:)] We found 8 in total. 4 different cache types : 3 traditionals, 2 multis, 1 earthcache and 1 letter box hybrid [^] This was a nice short multi to end the day with. Ackbar made the find. We got a nice surprise when we discovered a geocoin in it which we exchanged for a Green Jeep TB which has made it's way over from America.
