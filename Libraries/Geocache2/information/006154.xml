  <long-description><p>Although the Hill of Tara only stands 100m above the surrounding
countryside, on a clear day it commands a view over 40% of
Ireland.</p>
<p>For many centuries historians have worked to uncover The Hill of
Tara's mysteries, and suggested that from the time of the first
Celtic influence until the 1169 invasion of Richard de Clare, the
Hill of Tara was the island's political and spiritual capital. Due
to the history and archaeology of Ireland being not
well-integrated, and naturally evolving, archaeologists involved in
recent research suggest that the complete story of the wider area
around Hill of Tara remains untold.</p>
<p>The most familiar role played by the Hill of Tara in Irish
history is as the seat of the kings of Ireland until the 6th
century. This role extended until the 12th century, albeit without
its earlier splendor. Regardless, the significance of the Hill of
Tara predates Celtic times, although it has not been shown that
Tara was continuously important from the Neolithic to the 12th
century. The central part of the site could not have housed a large
permanent retinue, suggesting that it was used as an occasional
meeting place. There were no large defensive works. Certainly the
earliest records attest that high kings were inaugurated there, and
the "Seanchas Mor" legal text (written down after 600AD) specified
that they had to drink ale and symbolically marry the goddess Maeve
(Medb) to acquire the high-kingship.</p>
<p>Previous scholarly dispute over Tara's initial importance
advanced as archaeologists identified pre-Celtic monuments and
buildings dating back to the Neolithic period around 5,000 years
ago. One of these structures, the Mound of the Hostages, has a
short passage which is aligned with sunset on the true astronomical
cross-quarter days of November 8 and February 4, the ancient Celtic
festivals of Samhain and Imbolc. The mound's passage is shorter
than the long entryways of monuments like Newgrange, which makes it
less precise in providing alignments with the Sun.</p>

We sadly had to discover that ca each second cache has been wet sometimes with the log mouldy. Please check by your cache as soon as possible to change the log!

However as I was walking around to view all the mounds etc, I figured I might aswell grab the multi as I'm walking it anyway !  So having gotten as far at stage 8, I had to go back and get 1 - 3 .. and then from there to find the final location. Didn't take all that long to get all the clues, maybe 30/40 mins.
