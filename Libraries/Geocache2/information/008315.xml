<td valign="top">
<p>This cache is located on the pathway to a 5000 year old
megalithic burial mound called "Fuair Cnocs" (meaning The Cold
Hills). The mound is similar to Newgrange, but not as big and not
as well known; but it is well kept and a very interesting place to
visit (and certainly not as touristy as Newgrange is; there is no
visitors centre and entrance to the mound is free). There are two
other burial mounds very close by (in fact, you can see them from
Fuair Cnocs), but unfortunately they are on privately owned land.
Fuair Cnocs is located in the beautiful scenery of county Meath,
close to a town called Naul; the drive up to the cache along narrow
and bendy roads provides some wonderful views over the Irish
countryside out to the sea.</p>
<p>The cache is a small size plastic container. For a hint on the
how to find it, consult the spoiler photograph (which does not give
away too much :-) and optionally check the encrypted hint
below.<br />
 Please take care when retriving and replacing this
cache.</p></td></tr></table>

Found in the company of my muggle sister. She actually spotted the cache first! The place was empty and not suprisingly, as it was freezing out. There were icicles hanging from the rooftop entrance into the mound! On the drive up to the cache site we spotted a hunt about to get under way in a field close by. All the riders were dressed up and the horses looked great. We'll be back to see inside some time.
