TFTC</li><li>2010-06-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by Ginblue <br />Got this in on the last day of our sort break in Dublin before returning to Wales. Finding the cache was not the problem, doing so in such a crowd was! So we just acted like the tourists we were, fiddling about with maps, GPS and note books. Loved Dublin. TFTC Ginblue</li><li>2010-06-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by eve1987 <br />Not so easy with the hundreds of people :D
The man from the entrance would think we are stupid ;)

TFTC and kind regards from Austria, eve</li><li>2007-08-19T07:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Oh, so this is where the zoo is - looks a lot more modern than I've been told... must go there one day!

Found with Toadster and Cam. Stealth required but easy to hide amongst the crowds on this glorious afternoon.
