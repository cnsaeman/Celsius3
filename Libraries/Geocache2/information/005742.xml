  <long-description><p align="justify">Bitter, dark, strong with a dense, creamy foam.
That's GUINNESS. Its flavour is known all over the world. The
history of this special booze started in 1759, when Arthur Guinness
signed a 9000-year lease for the St. James's Gate Brewery, at an
annual rent of £45. In the 1770s Guinness started brewing porter
and six generations of the Guinness family have been brewing this
type of dark beer.<br />
Arthur Guinness II - the son of the brewery founder - developed the
business brewing a new type of beer "Extra Superior Porter". By the
1830s, St. James's Gate Brewery was the largest brewery in
Ireland.<br />
In 1862 the first trademark label for Guinness Stout was introduced
- it was under Benjamin's Lee Guinness leadership, Arthur II's
son.<br />
In 1886 the business was floated on the London Stock Exchange under
leadership of the new and first Chairman of the brewery, it became
the largest in the world.<br />
From 1962 until 1986 the Chairman of the Guinness family business
was Benjamin, Edward's great-grandson.<br />
In 1959 they launched Guinness Draught.<br />
<br />
By the end of 20th century, Guinness was brewed in over 40
countries and sold in over 150.<br />
<br />
Excluding drinks, the Guinness name is known from Guinness World
Records (known until 2000 as The Guinness Book of World Records).
Published annually, the book contains an internationally recognized
collection of world records, both human achievements and the
extremes of the natural world. The first edition was bound in 1955
and now is it the best-selling copyrighted series of all
time.<br />
<br />
Many people dream about placing their names in this book. Now you
have a chance to put your name (or nickname) in The Guinness
Logbook of World Records. Indeed, there are recorded visits of
geocachers from all over the world!</p>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Any visit to Dublin would be complete without the visit to this place [:D].

Thanks for this one...
