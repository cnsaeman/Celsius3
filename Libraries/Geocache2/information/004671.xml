TFTC</li><li>2010-04-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />Found this interesting cache this evening after searching for a while.
There were loads of muggles watching a football match & a young child banging a ball against the wall beside us.
We were just about to give up when BJ 59 spotted something unusual which turned out to be the "treasure".
