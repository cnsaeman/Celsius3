HERBERT PARK<br>
<br>
There was an old millrace on the river Dodder, the remains of which
may still be seen near the back gate from the park to the Dodder
pathway.<br>
At Herbert Park Lane there was a famous mill in the 17th century.
Calico was printed and processed there and the whole area was used
as a “bleaching green” where the cloth was laid out on the
grass.<br>
When Johnston Mooney and O’Brien took it over they converted it
into a “landmark” bakery in Dublin 4. which operated here for 150
years.<br>
Herbert Park is named after the Right Honourable Sidney Herbert
1810-1861 Lord Herbert of Lea. He was the father of the Earl of
Pembroke who offered the land to the Pembroke Urban District
Council for public use in 1903.<br>
The Great Exhibition of 1907 took place here. It included national
exhibits and fine arts and industrial displays from many
countries.<br>
It took 5 years to construct the massive stands and entertainments.
The whole “British Empire” was represented and it included an
“Indian village” and a spectacular Canadian water slide into the
pond which forms part of today’s park. <br>
After the exhibition the park was officially opened on 19th August
1911 and in 1932 it was taken over by Dublin Corporation.<br>
The facilities in the park include 18 tennis courts, 3 football
pitches, a bowling green and a children’s playing area.<br>
In 1997 during the development of the bakery site, a major
pedestrian mall was created through to Ballsbridge.<br>
The area around this park includes some of the most expensive real
estate in Ireland and rivals values in many other parts of
Europe.</long-description>

Thanks for the cache (and the surprising hiding place)</li><li>2010-02-27T20:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />This cache is in a nice hiding place. I actually felt around the place on a previous visit but an extra stretch today brought the required result.

Found the resting rotarian quickly and then went fishing, well Toffee Man did, I couldn't reach....

TFTC - lovely park, I had never been in here, though passed many times.

Thanks to some dubious maths (never trust the maths of the stranger you pick up caching...) we spent a good while searching the exact wrong spot and getting frustrated, especially after our earlier DNF. A re-think and recalculation sent us straight to the cache. 

Brushed off the hitch-hikers on the cache - it's in great condition.
