  <long-description><p align="justify"><b>Explosions:</b><br />
<br />
 On Friday evening, 17th May 1974 three no-warning car bombs
exploded in the centre of Dublin. Previously (1972, 1973), there
were car bomb explosions and victims, but never so tragic. The same
day in 1974 a 4th explosion killed people in Monaghan so on that
day 33 people lost their lives and about 300 were injured. They
were the worst paramilitary attacks in 20th-century in
Ireland.<br />
In 1993 The Ulster Volunteer Force (Loyalist group from Northern
Ireland) claimed responsibility for the bombings.<br />
<br />

Off to an internet cafe, e-mail the owner, who luckily was online. As it turned out I had one number wrong. And it turned out I was only 300 meters away from that spot.
