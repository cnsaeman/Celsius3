  <long-description><center><b>Charles Cobbe</b></center>
<center>Charles Cobbe was born in 1686, in Hampshire,
England.<br />
In August 1717 Charles arrived in Ireland, as chaplain to Charles
Paulet, 2nd Duke of Bolton. He occupied a number of ecclesiastical
positions before becoming Archbishop of Dublin on 10th March
1743</center>
<br />
<center>As Archbishop of Dublin (fourth in precedence in the
government of Ireland), Charles could have expected to succeed as
Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland. However, his
ambition received a serious blow when, in April 1747, George Stone,
Bishop of Derry and 22 years Charles' junior, was appointed to the
See of Armagh.</center>

<center><b>Newbridge House, Donabate</b></center>
<center>On June 19th 1736 Charles Cobbe paid £5,526 5s 6d for the
townlands of Donabate, Lainstown, Haggardstown and Newbridge,
containing 490 acres. On 21st July 1742 for the sum of £6,425,
Charles made his second purchase of lands in the parish, consisting
of the townlands of Kilcreagh, Corballis and Baltra - 510 acres in
all.</center>
<br />
<center>It was at Donabate, 12 miles north of Dublin, that Charles
had Newbridge House (the Family Seat of the Cobbes in Ireland)
built between 1747 and 1752 to a design by the architect James
Gibbs. The Georgian mansion replaced the Stuart house that existed
on the estate when he bought it. The house remained in the
ownership of the Cobbe family until 1986 when, under an arrangement
with the family, it was transferred to the care of Fingal County
Council.</center>

My GPS just didn't play ball and an emergency call to the Windsockers was the only reason I found it. I was already within metres but it still took a while to find. Quite a container and you could say that the cache was simmering with loads of goodies! Took a GC and the trackable adventure guide, and left 2 travel bugs. The third of 6 finds for today. Thanks to Windsockers for his help and thanks for this great cache.

A hasty departure soon led me to ground zero but not before confronting a young deer in the undergrowth I didn't know they had them on the grounds and I think he got a bit of a shock seeing me appear from the bushes.
Nice to see the cache simmering with lots of ingredients took the tbs left a few from today’s ramblings.
