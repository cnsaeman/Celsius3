  <description><p>A short climb with great views on Bray Head in Co. Wicklow</p>
<img src="http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g104/fjon/72fca86d.jpg" /></description>
  <long-description>The cache is located in a small tab-lock box near the summit of
Bray Head. <br />
Bray head (241m) is located at the southern end of the Bray
seafront, and the walk up to the summit is very popular. <br />
 <br />
<br />
 <b>Getting there:</b><br />
 If you are driving, you can park at N53 11.708, W6 05.358. <br />
You can also reach the cache by public transport (DART or Dublin
Bus). <br />
From the car park, follow the path up the hill. There are many
different paths up to the summit, which one you take shouldn't
matter<br />
 too much, but be aware that some can be quite steep!<br />
You should soon reach the cross on the summit. The cache is nearby,
in a place with fewer muggles, but with equally stunning
views.<br />
You may need to go through a metal gate to get there - please be
sure to close it after you!.<br />
While it is by no means a difficult hike, you should nonetheless
wear approriate shoes, especially as the path can at times get a
bit muddy.<br />
<p><b>And after...</b><br />
If you have some time left you can also use this as a starting
point for the spectacular 7km Bray-Greystones cliff walk.<br />
There are currently also 3 caches along this route.<br />
If you feel like some refreshment or food there are plenty of pubs
on the Bray seafront. The chicken wings in The Porter House are
definitely recommended!</p>
