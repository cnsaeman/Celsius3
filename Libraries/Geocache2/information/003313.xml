<p>You can park your car at N 53. 22. 874 and W 006. 04. 669.</p>
<p>From the car park follow the path to the right of the hotel and
continue up the hill.</p>
<p>The cache is a small container with logbook, pencil, some
goodies and a new not yet registered travel bug = FTF price.</p>
<p>NOTE: The location might become very slippery in the winter or
in wet weather. Kids should be supervised at all times.</p></long-description>
