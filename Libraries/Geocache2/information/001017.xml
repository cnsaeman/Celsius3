  <logs><ul><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by kaputing <br />Nice one, rain stopped as we arrived. Quick find. Took Coin and left one of the many golf balls we found when looking for a walk in the park!
TFTC</li><li>2010-04-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by redflame1 <br />Gale force winds made the going up from the car park tough......lunched in the lee of a small copse just off the 'Way' before attempting the 'final assault' through the heather to the 'Rock'.....climbed eagerly but just like a previous adventurer we also found this one very difficult to find.....60 hard minutes of searching in the biting wind and still no luck....every possible crevice poked and peered into.....and then just at the moment of desperation.....EUREKA!...the 'Rock' gave it up!!  Thanks for this cache....really enjoyed it. In: Walpurgis witch Geocoin. Out: nothing </li><li>2010-03-13T20:00:00Z : Found it by Spark_ie <br />A lovely spot to rest the body for lunch.. Had to grab the cache first though, and from a distance looking at the cache location, I thought it was going to be a nightmare, especially given the previous logs from finders... Found the cache within moments however [:D]  Lovely views, TFTC, Spark_ie</li><li>2009-09-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by didi2206 <br />Nearly gave up.. well hidden, small cache.. took a lovely ring, left a small spray bottle of mens cologne (sorry!)
TFTC</li><li>2009-05-24T19:00:00Z : Found it by Duchodci <br />On our mountain trek. You can see the record of it here: http://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=401176
We recommend to take the same way back to cark park, we tried to go down hill to the valey and it was a bit boring. Thanks MaJa</li></ul></logs>
