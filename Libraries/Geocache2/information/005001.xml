  <long-description><p>The Harbour comprised two limestone piers with lighthouse
positioned at end of east pier. The East pier is largely of
limestone rubble with concrete poured on main pathway while west
pier is of coursed limestone blocks. The simple lighthouse is
accessed through the adjoining single-bay single-storey building
with steps up to entrance level.</p>
<p>The lighthouse has two plaques reading "This pier was built by
the Honorable George Hamilton of Hampton in the county of Dublin
Third Baron of His Majesty's count of the Exchequer in Ireland
whose great object in life was to promote the trade and prosperity
in His country"</p>
<p>"Erected by people of Balbriggan in proud & loving memory of
their townsman Patrick Joseph Hanley aged 29 years who from near
this spot on the night of August 24th at the height of a violent
storm set out, alone, in a Sam boat to the rescue of two friends
whom he believed in peril in the outer sea and in this Endeavour
lost his own life.” Greater love than this, no man hath/that a man
lay down his life for his friends John 15, 13".</p>
