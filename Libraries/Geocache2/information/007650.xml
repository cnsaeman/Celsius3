  <long-description><p align="justify"><b>Monument:</b><br />
<br />
Of course it's not an Aztec temple or other ancient place of
worship but it looks like one (especially form height, look at
Google Maps). This structure is known as Wellington Monument or
Wellington Testimonial. It was built to commemorate the victories
of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington who was born in Dublin.
Known as "Iron Duke", he was a famous an Anglo-Irish soldier and
statesman, one of the leading military and political figures of the
19th century, and the victor of the Battle of Waterloo.<br />
<br />
This monument was completed in 1861 and it's the tallest obelisk in
Europe (62 m high). It was intended to be taller but funding run
short.<br />
<br />
<b>The cache:</b><br />
<br />
The cache is a regular size container and includes a logbook,
pencil and some goodies for trade. Good luck!</p>

Not so fast! It turns out I'll need to do some more thinking and another visit will be called for.

[:D] will have to come another time with new coordinates..</li><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by anacreon <br />I first came looking for this on the day it was published. 291 days and three trips to the park later, found it! I suspect the cache was there on trip #2 but I was fighting daylight and closing time; trip #3 was during darkness for On Reflection, but nothing was going to stop me using my super-sleuth puzzle solving co-ordinates. Found after a quick trek through the woods. One more toczygroszek puzzle ticked off.

Major pleased to find this one. So after several (ok more than several) nights on the computer all was revealed. Learned a lot about the Mayan's on the way too. Interesting culture. 
Finally solved the puzzle & got the co-ords, went to find it and no cache [:(]
So to-day we got back to search again (thanks for the replacement Jamie) and had the cache in hand in 10 seconds. 
Great cache & the hardest I've got anyhow. (so far, but there is the Nagged , and Revenge  and all those fish etc etc)
#300 for us [:D] [:D]
