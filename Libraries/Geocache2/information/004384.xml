You can leave your car on the car park at the first church. The
busy N3 road goes through Dunshaughlin, be careful when crossing
it!</description>
  <long-description>The village of Dunshaughlin originally developed where the main
Dublin to Cavan route was intersected with the Trim road and number
of county roads. Dunshaughlin derives it’s name from „Domhnach
Seachnaill“ meaning the church of St. Seachnall. Saint Seachnaill,
a contemporary of Saint Patrick, established his church in
Dunshaughlin on the site of the present day Church of Ireland in
the 5th century. Dunshaughlin (or more specifically, the townland
of Lagore) is famous for an ancient crannog or settlement from the
7th century where a number of Irish antiquities were discovered.
Approximately 1.6 km south of the village is a preserved workhouse
from An Gorta Mór, which was abolished by the Irish State in the
early twenties. The workhouse is currently under private ownership
and is not open to the public. Today, Dunshaughlin with its
location 29 km from Dublin on the N3 road, is a thriving satellite
town of the nation's capital consisting primarily of a main street,
with numerous retail units. It has grown considerably over the last
20 years. <br />

<p><b>Church of Saints Patrick and Seachnaill</b> (stage 1)</p>
<br />
 
<p>In 1979 the people of Dunshaughlin realised, that there is a
need for a new church. The members of the committee of the
parishioners volunteered to look after the design of the proposed
building and a fundraising campaign was launched. Work on the new
building commenced in 1981 and the dedication ceremony took place
on 14th November 1982.<br />

<p><b>Saint Patrick’s church</b> (stage 2)</p>
<p>First there was a chapel standing on this site. In 1856 an
attempt was made to dispossess the Catholics of Dunshaughlin of
their chapel, but then new lease was obtained in 1857. Some
renovation took place in years 1878-1882 and an extension towards
the road with a new front and belfry was built. St. Sechnall was
the medieval patron, but as his name does not appear in the Roman
Martyrology, the Congregation of Rites refused to sanction him as
titular.The church was dedicated to St. Patrick. In 1983, when the
new church was finished, the church was sold to Meath County
Council. Today you can find there a nice public library.<br />
<br />
<b>Beside the entrance to the library, there is a huge famine
cauldron. On the wall you can find a plate with some information.
For how many years was the cauldron used in the soup kitchen? Call
this number D.</b></p>

<br />
<p><b>Saint Seechnall’s church</b> (stage 3)</p>
<p>Although the present Church of Ireland church in Dunshaughlin
dates only from 1814, it stands on a very ancient site, the
original church being founded by St. Sechnall. The ruins of a
pre-sixteenth century church (only one-and-a-half arches) stand
close to the present building. Of great interest is also a lintel
dating from twelfth century or earlier, now incorporated in the
western end of the ruins, which depicts the crucification with two
soldiers thrusting spears into Our Lord’s side. The Church today is
a fairly small country church which seats about a hundred people.
Above the entrance is a tablet which reads: „This Church and
Steeple were rebuilt and ornamented in the Year of Our Lord 1814,
the Reverend William H. Irvine, Rector and Messrs George E. Irvine
and James Dempsey Church Wardens by James Graham of Dunshaughlin,
Mason.“ The Reverend William Irvine, Rector 1788-1818, is buried
under the arch of the old church with his son the Reverend George
Irvine, also Rector of Dunshaughlin, 1818-1839.</p>
