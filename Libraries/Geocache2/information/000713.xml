Another little addition to an already cache filled trek across
a<br />
great section of the Wicklow Mountains. A straight forward short
climb close to the road if you are doing only this cache. Best to
go up the forest track for a couple of hundred metres and you will
see several easy access points to the gentlest ridge climb to the
short summit. Cache is quite close to the cairn on top.<br />

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-15T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />I'm really enjoying these "Walk in the Garden" caches. It's great to have a walking route planned out for you, and to benefit from the cache owner's deep and intimate knowledge of these mountains. I never knew the name of this distinctive mountain before, and it was my first time to climb it. It's a nice quick steep climb, a short run up from the handy parking spot. Was surprised and pleased to get First to Find. Went on to Mullaghcleevaun and Duff Hill (2 old scores settled!) Lovely walk on a fine Sunday afternoon, thanks!</li><li>2010-04-30T20:09:04Z : Publish Listing by Croaghan <br />Published</li></ul></logs>
