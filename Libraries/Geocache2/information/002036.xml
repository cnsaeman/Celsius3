This cache is near Dygby Bridge on the Grand Canal towpath.
The Grand Canal was built ca. 1756 to 1803 and links Dublin to the Shannon. Ireland's longest river.

The towpaths are always worth a visit. There are 2 long distance way marked ways The Barrow- and The Kildare Way and numerous looped ways and trails.</long-description>
