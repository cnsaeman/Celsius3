The coordinates for the second location are N53 18.ABC W6 16.DEF, A = Last digit of date; B = 1st digit of building number; C = 2nd digit of building number; D = 2nd digit of date; E = 2nd digit of date - 3rd digit of date; F = 1st digit of date + 3 digit of date.

At the second location there is another plaque with a connection to the first one. To get to the third location you need dates from plaque and the house number.

The coordinates for the third location are N53 19.GHI W6 16.JKL. G = 3rd digit of 1st date; H = 1st digit of house number *2-1; I = 3rd digit of 2nd date; J = add all digits of house number; K = 2nd digit of house number; L = last two digits of 2nd date - house number.

At the third location another plaque with a connection to the first two. Get the house number and date. The coordinates for the final location are N53 1A.MCN W6 1F.ODP. A,C,D and F as above; M = Add both digits of house number - 3; N = 2nd digit of house number; O = add both digits of house number; P = Last digit of date.

  <logs><ul><li>2010-01-13T20:00:00Z : Found it by Kolingen <br />This was a tough bicycle tour in a windy, cold and rainy Dublin. But at last I came to the final stage and could log. Thanks for the short distance to the nearest pub and T4TC

# 684</li><li>2010-01-02T20:00:00Z : Found it by Mac Aroni Senior <br />This was a long one. Very enjoyable walk around our own backyard on a very cold day. Caffeine shot badly needed by the time we got to the third clue and as by magic a lovely coffeeshop materialised. TFTC - good one.</li><li>2010-01-02T20:00:00Z : Found it by Miss Teak <br />Yippee. First ever find. Under supervision of Mac Aroni Senior. Had great fun with all the clues. Have been living in the area all my life and never realised the history of those buildings. Loads of muggles about. Managed to retrieve and replace without problems. Very cold day - revitalised in nice coffee shop near third clue - we did this walking you see.  TFTC.</li><li>2009-10-24T19:00:00Z : Found it by Spark_ie <br />Started this one a few nights ago. As previous cachers stated, the starting co-ords are a little bit out (can't remember how much), but with a bit of searching I found the plaque. I had to go to the second stage a few times as by the time I got there after cycling from work It was too dark to read the sign. Got the final co-ords last night, and cycled out there today amidst the rain and howling wind! Had the park, steet and whole area to myself, no-one around (And I wouldn't blame them!).  Took a little while to locate the cache, when in the end it was right there infront of me !!  Perfect final co-ords, Thanks for the cache, nice to know the places now [:)]  Spark_ie</li><li>2009-07-28T19:00:00Z : Found it by nisse_perlemo <br />Thanks for this engaging and interesting cache.
Well hidden, it is difficult to retrieve and replace without the feeling of being watched. </li></ul></logs>
