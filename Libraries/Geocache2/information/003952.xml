TFTC, Merann. </li><li>2010-05-01T19:00:00Z : Found it by anxie <br />An unscheduled visit this time and easy in the end. we had nothing 2 leave, but will give the gcoin a nice new home :) 
TFTC!</li><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by danomalley <br />Possibly the quickest find I've ever had -- the coordinates were spot-on and I literally found it within 30 seconds of getting to the zero point. This place is only about 5 mins drive from my house, I'm amazed I never bothered to go pick up this cache before. TFTC!

Took: hair clip, balloon, whistle
Left: beetle toy, mini skittle set, Kinder Surprise toy & geocoin</li><li>2009-07-19T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Out for a day of caching with JME1979 - this was our second find for the day and my 299th overall. </li></ul></logs>
