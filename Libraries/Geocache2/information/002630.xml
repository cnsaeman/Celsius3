<p><b>Malahide railway station is located on the main
Dublin-Belfast railway line.</b></p></center>
<p>The station opened 1844. The present station was built entirely
by Great Northern Railway, they constructed a typical yellow brick
station building as well as the footbridge and signal cabin.<br />
 There's also the typical GNR stations masters’ house adjacent to
the station. All of these are well maintained, and the station
building retains its GNR canopy.<br />
 In 2000 Malahide became the second northern terminus of the DART
service.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>Side-Tracked Caches are intended to provide quick
Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations.</p>
<p>The Cache is a small micro container please rehide it well to
prevent the many muggles from discovering it.</p>
