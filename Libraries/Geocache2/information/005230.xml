The series will bring you to stadia, both old and new, of Dublin
city and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the love of
all sport that is alive, not only in this city, but in the country

They are impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities.<br />

<br />
<b>The National Stadium</b> (Irish: An Staidiam
N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta) is one of Ireland&rsquo;s best known
boxing venues.The venue is situated between Clanbrassil Street to
the east and Dolphin's Barn to the west on the South Circular Road,
Dublin 8.The National Stadium was the first purpose built boxing
stadium in the world and was opened in 1939.The stadium is owned by
the Irish Amateur Boxing Association (IABA) and has been used by
the IABA for over 60 years as the venue for their national and
international contests.<br />
<br />
The stadium stages Amateur and Professional Boxing and Professional
Wrestling bouts as well as providing facilities for music concerts,
conferences and corporate hospitality events.<br />
<br />
The capacity of the stadium is 2,080 for music events, which is
reduced to 1,954 for boxing and wrestling events to accommodate the
wrestling/boxing ring. The Ringside club seats up to 300 people for
parties or sit down dining but some junior boxing events also take
place here.<br />
<br />
In December 1999, the then minister for the Department of Art,
Sports and Tourism. Dr. James McDaid, announced a IR&pound;1.3m
(&euro;1.6m) grant under the Sports Capital Programme to undertake
the refurbishment of the stadium. The two-storey building was
provided with a new grey coloured limestone fa&ccedil;ade during
the refurbishment..<br />
<br />
<b>The cache</b> is a micro. Don't forget to bring your own pen.
<p>Stealth is required in this urban location. Please be aware of
the many people who pass by this busy spot, and replace the cache
exactly as you found it, ensuring it is not visible.</p></long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-26T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by tmob <br />We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

It was getting late, and we were not in the mood. 

Thanks for this one...
Greetings from Portugal</li><li>2010-05-24T19:00:00Z : Found it by THE_Chris <br />I didnt know Dublin had a boxing arena, and evidentally neither did the group of thugs who were having a bare knuckle fight outside the venue when I got there. I camped out on the other side of the road and it turned out it was just a group of friends having a laugh. More of them turned up and went quickly to the off-licence. I took the opportunity and grabbed the cache. Nice easy find. TFTC.</li><li>2010-05-15T19:00:00Z : Found it by AbbeyAckbar <br />(#635 @ 14:15)
Through a course I'm studying I've been attending classes held in Griffith college next door throughout the year. I had no idea this stadium was right beside it and I was here years ago at my first ever concert 'Dina Carroll' back in 1993! I was here a couple of weeks ago and I tried to get the cache then but there was some event going on at the stadium and it was far too busy to go looking for it. Today, thankfully, the area was muggle free, that is except for my muggle classmate who accompanied me on the hunt for this cache. She had never heard of geocaching before and I think she found it interesting or amusing at the very least [:o)] Why is it so hard to explain to people the love of signing a piece of paper you find in a container hidden anywere in the world?! I was happy to see the note accompanying the logsheet explaining geocaching so I could show her. Signed log and replaced as found.
