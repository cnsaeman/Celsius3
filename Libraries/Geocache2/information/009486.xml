  <description>Part of the Naas Canal Bridge Series</description>
  <long-description>The Osberstown Bridge is located at Lock #1 of the Naas Branch of the Grand Canal. The bridge was built along with other bridges on the spur in the late 18th century. 

The cache is a micro, 35mm film canister wrapped in black fabric. You will need to bring a pen/pencil. The road is very busy during rush hour and school runs, but quiet enough the rest of the day.  This cache is part of a series of canal bridge caches that starts in Naas. 

There is a small parking space for one car close to the hide. The cache is not on the road. You do not need to go down close to the water. 

Watch for muggles and please rehide carefully</long-description>
