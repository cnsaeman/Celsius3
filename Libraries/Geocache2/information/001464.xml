  <description>The cache is located in Raheny village beside the Catholic parish church: Our Lady, Mother of Divine Grace which was designed by Peppard and Duffy architects & opened on Sunday, July 22, 1962</description>
  <long-description>There’s a car park at the cache location, but as of 01st Jan '09, it's pay & display (this came into effect to reduce Dart commuters using the carpark).

Update 27th June : Workers are finished reconstructing the bell tower in the church and assembling the prefab building for the credit union's temporary location. There will be quite alot of activity during the day, so watch out for muggles!

The cache is an unusual container. 

PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS CONTAINER DOWN FROM ITS LOCATION.

The cache log & contents are in a tube, which is easily retrievable from the outer container.

Thx, eve</li><li>2010-05-21T19:00:00Z : Found it by GudrunXY <br />Found quickly, but all the cameras around made me really nervous.
TFTC, GudrunXY</li><li>2010-05-15T19:00:00Z : Found it by Nagrom1 <br />Quick sneak in and out without paying the parking fee. TFTC</li><li>2010-03-05T20:00:00Z : Found it by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Lovely cache...exactly what I was expecting!

Thankfully there was no "Flood" that I had to deal with en route!!! I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the "Blue Canary" but sadly it wasn't to be.

I forgot to bring a pen with me but after scouring the pavement on the way to the cache I found a bookies pen! Sadly it was barely working so scribing my name on the log sheet was very difficult...you should be able to make it out. If not I can send a photo for proof of find.

Thanks for the cache.

Jamie</li><li>2010-02-22T20:00:00Z : Found it by anacreon <br />Must be some sort of jinx with me and AbbeyAckbar caches... things never seem to go smoothly. "This is a private area" explained the man from the credit union hut; I mumbled something about a treasure hunt and got out of there. Nice container though :) TFTC!</li></ul></logs>
