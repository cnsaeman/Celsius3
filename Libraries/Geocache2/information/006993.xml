  <long-description><p>Merrion Square is situated on the south side of Dublin city
centre and is considered one of the city's finest Georgian
squares.<br />
The square was laid out after 1762 and was largely complete by the
beginning of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Several notable buildings face on to the square, including
Leinster House (seat of the Oireachtas), the Natural History
building of the National Museum of Ireland, the National Maternity
Hospital and the National Gallery of Ireland. The Irish Red Cross,
the Central Catholic Library, the Irish Traditional Music Archive
and the Irish Georgian Society have their headquarters on the
square.</p>
<p>The park in the square is now known as "Archbishop Ryan Park".
The square was leased to the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin by the
Pembroke Estate in 1930 to permit the building of a Cathedral on
the site. Despite efforts over the next 20 years to advance the
project, no progress was made and the site was transferred to the
city of Dublin in 1974. Now managed by Dublin City Council, it
contains a statue of Oscar Wilde, who resided in No. 1, Merrion
Square from 1855 to 1876, many other sculptures and a collection of
old Dublin lamp standards.</p>
<p>Until about the 1950s, the houses in the square were largely
residential, but today most of them are used for office
accommodation.</p>
<p>The poet W. B. Yeats lived at No 82 Merrion Square (tours are
free if you inquire within), and Daniel O'Connell, Catholic
emancipator of Ireland, called "The Liberator," resided at 58
Merrion Square (now home to the Keough-Naughton Notre Dame Centre).
A number of houses in the square have plaques with historical
information on former notable residents, including A.E. (George
William Russell) and Sheridan Le Fanu.</p></long-description>
