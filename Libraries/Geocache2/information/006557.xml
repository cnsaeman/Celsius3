<center><i>North Strand after bombing
(www.fantasyjackpalance.com)</i></center>
<br />
<br />
<p align="justify"><b>WWII:</b><br />
<br />
During World War II Ireland declared itself neutral. Nevertheless,
some German bombs were dropped on Irish land in 1940-41 killing and
injuring many people and destroying some buildings. Several reasons
are discussed by historians, as some of the bombing areas were
strategic for Great Britain. However, the official explanation was
pilot error.<br />
<br />
<b>Raid on Dublin:</b><br />
<br />
On 31 May 1941 just after midnight bombs exploding in the distance
were heard. Searchlights began sweeping the sky and anti-aircraft
batteries began shooting at planes. Two squadrons of Luftwaffe
aircraft began raid on the capital of the neutral country. At 1:30
am bombs began falling onto Dublin. North Strand suffered most
severely as 4 high-explosives bombs were dropped here.<br />
<br />
<b>Aftermath:</b><br />
<br />
Different reports quote different numbers of victims. One of them
mentions about 29 people killed, 90 people injured and 300
destroyed and damaged houses. About 400 people were left
permanently or temporarily homeless.<br />
In 1958 West Germany took responsibility for the raid and paid
compensation of IR&pound;327,000.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Stage 1:</b><br />
<br />
At this stage you will see the memorial with description, where you
will find two dates.<br />
Sum up the four digits of the year in the 1st date and call it
<b>AB</b>.<br />
Sum up the four digits of the the year in the 2nd date and call it
<b>CD</b>.<br />
<br />
The final cache is at coordinates:<br />
<br />
<font color="blue"><b>N 53&deg; 21.(B-A) D (A+B+C)<br />
W 006&deg; 14.(A+B) (B-A) (B*C-A)<br /></b></font><br />
<b>The cache:</b><br />
<br />
On the way to the cache you will pass buildings replacing housing
damaged by the bomb. The cache is a micro container and includes a
logbook only. Please bring your own pen.<br />
<br />
You can visit the local library (N 53&deg; 21.433 W 006&deg;
14.765), where there is an exhibition of pictures taken after
bombing. The exhibition will be open in May and June 2009. More
