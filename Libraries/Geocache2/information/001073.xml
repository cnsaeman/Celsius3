  <long-description>In the grounds of the Belfield campus of NUI - near a building
which was once part of Trinity College, but was transported block
by block in the 1970's to its current location. This building was
constructed especially to house experiments related to magnetism
and there is no magnetic material whatsoever used in its
construction.</long-description>

Then, through luck or whatever, I spotted the cache lying on the ground, a couple of feet from it's intended location. I may even have dislodged it myself.

Anyway, it's now back in place, with some light camoflague.
