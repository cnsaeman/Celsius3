It is hidden near the pond's edge (No need to swim! or enter the
water whatsoever :) ).<br />

Thank you for the cache in a nice location.</li><li>2010-06-05T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by chatcar <br />Damned! Too early...park was closed!</li><li>2010-05-26T13:32:57Z : Enable Listing by AbbeyAckbar <br />This is the 3rd container i've placed for Park Life cache, so i've placed this one in a new location not far from its original spot. It is now secured to the tree so it won't go missing easily. The really weird thing is that as I was looking for a new hiding spot for the cache I found the 1st container that had gone missing! It had strayed quite a distance from its hiding place, but was positioned upright in a tree crevice with it's contents inside so I guess someone found it and placed it there!?! It was great to get the container back [:)] I wonder will I find the latest missing container a few months down the road...</li><li>2010-05-26T11:08:56Z : Update Coordinates by erik88l-r <br />** Coordinates Changed From **
