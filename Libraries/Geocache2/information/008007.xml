  <description>This cache is part of series dedicated to Irish sport. The
coordinates above are for reference only. For the real coords you
will need to complete a sport quiz , which is mixture of questions
about games rules, Irish sportsmen,and general knowledge of Irish
and international sport and history. For some it might be easy and
for others rather tricky but that's the name of the game. Good
luck!</description>

</p></center>
<p>Parnell Park is a Gaelic Athletic Association stadium in
Donnycarney, Dublin, Ireland with a capacity of about 13,500. It is
the home of the Dublin GAA hurling, football, camogie and ladies'
football teams at all levels of competition. Parnell Park is
nicknamed The Nell .</p>
<p>The ground is used by Dublin's inter-county teams mainly during
home National Football League matches and as a training ground,
with major NFL and All-Ireland Championship games normally played
in Croke Park. However, All-Ireland Senior Football Championship,
All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, Railway Cup Dublin Club
Championships and other competitions also take place in Parnell
Park every year. Parnell Park also serves as the headquarters of
the Dublin County Board. Parnell Park follows the standard
four-sided design of most stadiums .The Ground has a main stand on
the north side of the pitch which can seat about 3,500. The main
stand is covered and has one tier. The stand includes facilities
and shops under the stand. The rest of the ground is terraced with
the majority of it covered, although some of the main terrace on
the south side is not covered. The terrace on the west side of the
ground is known as the Church end due to it being near Donnycarney
Church. The terraces in Parnell are all one tier and the facilities
and shops are at the rear or the side depending on which terrace
you are in. The terraces in Parnell Park can hold about 10,000. In
2004 late work began to install flood lights in Parnell Park. The
first competitive match under lights was played in 2005 and saw
Dublin defeat Mayo 2-13 to 1-15.</p>

#79 </li><li>2009-11-22T20:00:00Z : Found it by Blue Jay 59 <br />Last (16th) of a long mad caching day around north Dublin with Toffee Man. New record for us and I think it'll be a while before we rival it. [:)]
We worked out the answers to the quiz last night - well when I say we worked them out, I mean I read out the questions and wrote down the answers Toffee Man told me. I don't do sport. Prof. Google was only called on once for a confirmation. Unlike Spark_ie Toffee Man knew the Ulster one as it is his home county [:D] 
I have been to Parnell Park a few times with my boys playing school football etc. 
Thanks for the quiz & the cache. Nice one for my 80th too. We also worked out "My name is ..." last night, but couldn't do it today as it was closed. Another day .....
Good day.
