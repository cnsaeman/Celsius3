This is a small multi cache which can be achieved quite easily
& quickly</p>
<br />
<p><b>Dunshaughlin</b> (Irish: D&uacute;n Seachlainn, meaning
"Seachlann's fort",or locally Irish: Domhnach Seachnaill) is a town
in Meath.</p>
<br />
<p>The Dunshaughlin Workhouse survives to the present day with its
original appearance. It was built in the Gothic revival style of
the mid nineteenth century with pointed windows and diamond shaped
panes of glass.</p>
<br />
<p>The Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, was passed in 1838. It was
loosely based on the model being promoted for England and Scotland.
Initially, 130 Irish Unions were created, with an additional 33
being added in 1848-50. Under the Poor Law system a workhouse was a
place where people who were unable to support themselves, could go
to live and work. Boards of Guardians were elected annually. The
new workhouse building project began in January 1839, with the
arrival in Dublin of architect George Wilkinson, who had designed a
number of workhouses in England and Wales. Wilkinson was employed,
at a salary of &pound;500 per annum, to undertake the design work
for all 130 new workhouses. His brief from the Poor Law
Commissioners stated that: 'The style of building is intended to be
of the cheapest description compatible with durability; and effect
is aimed at by harmony of proportion and simplicity of arrangement,
all mere decoration being studiously excluded.&rsquo;</p>
<br />
<p>Within two months, Wilkinson had devised model plans upon which
almost all Irish workhouse buildings would be based. By April 1843,
112 of the new workhouses were finished, and 18 others were almost
complete.</p>
<br />
<p>For those that did enter the workhouse, conditions were often
miserable. Dormitories were cramped and lacking ventilation. Beds
consisted of a platform of planks and a straw mattress covered with
rough rags. There was often a lack of water and at night, the only
toilet facilities were large urination tubs in each ward which
often overflowed. Diet relied heavily on oatmeal, buttermilk and
potatoes.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>The Dunshaughlin Workhouse</b> was erected in 1840-41 on a 5
acre site, 1.5 miles to the south of Dunshaughlin, the building was
planned to accommodate 400 inmates. Its construction cost
&pound;4,938 plus &pound;912 for fittings etc. The building was
declared fit for habitation on May 12 1841, and received its first
admissions on 17 May &ndash;the first paupers; "two destitute
persons, a man and a woman" were admitted.</p>
<br />
<p>Workhouse conditions were deliberately harsh to deter the
able-bodied idle poor from relying on them. Men and women were
segregated and children were separated from their parents. Aged
pauper couples who by definition were neither idle nor criminal
were not allowed to share a bedroom. By entering a workhouse
paupers were held to have forfeited responsibility for their
children. Education was provided but pauper children were often
forcibly apprenticed without the permission or knowledge of their
parents. Inmates surrendered their own clothes and wore a
distinctive uniform.</p>
<br />
<p>During the famine in the mid-1840s, stables and probationary
wards were converted into sleeping apartments to accommodate an
additional 71 inmates. Initially, 25 fever patients were treated in
a house hired for use as a fever hospital, with the workhouse
stables also fitted up for the reception of new patients. A fever
hospital was subsequently erected to the north of the workhouse. A
burial ground was located to the rear of the workhouse.</p>
<br />
<p>In the late 1840s, the front administrative block was extended
at its northern end with the addition of a three-storey wing
containing children's accommodation and schoolrooms. To the rear of
this block stood the two-storey main accommodation block. The
accommodation block was linked at the rear to an infirmary and to
the wards for "idiots", by a central spine containing the
dining-hall and chapel. A small ventilation tower in the centre of
the infirmary improved the circulation of air through the
building.</p>
<br />
<p>In the post-famine years, the workhouse rarely had more than a
few dozen inmates. At the start of the First World War, the site
was initially commandeered for military use. After being found
unsuitable for accommodating soldiers, it was fitted up to house
125 Belgian refugees and thereafter became as a holding depot for
refugees until they could be placed elsewhere. Some refugees died
during their residence at the workhouse and were buried in the
paupers' graveyard. In 1920-21, the building was taken over as a
barracks by the 'Black and Tans' &mdash; a British reservist force
&mdash; during the War of Independence.</p>
<br />
<p>The Irish War of Independence culminated in the signing of the
Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6th December 1921. Between June 1922 and May
1923, a further conflict took place in the form of the Irish Civil
War. During this, and the previous struggles, many workhouses had
undergone military occupation and had been damaged or burnt down.
Of the remainder:</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>33 became County Homes offering relief to the elderly and
chronic invalid</li>
<li>32 became District or Fever Hospitals</li>
<li>9 became County Hospitals</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Following the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, the
workhouse system was abolished.</p>
<br />
<p>Dunshaughlin Workhouse buildings subsequently had a variety of
uses including a school, a courthouse and a factory.</p>
<br />
<p>Today Dunshaughlin Workhouse is one of the few of the original
163 left for us to see and get a real feel for what these buildings
were like. The entrance and administration block has been
refurbished for use as a guest-house. The remainder of the
buildings are derelict.</p>
<br />
<p><i>Stand at the gates and image the despair and dread that was
felt by the people entering here.</i></p>

<p><b>To find the cache</b> you need to go to the co-ordinates

<p>Please note this is a very busy road.<br /></p>
<p>Count the number of letters in the second word on the plaque at

<p>The cache is a 900ml tab lock box in a black cloth. When placed
it contained a small FTF prize, logbook,pencil & parer, several
