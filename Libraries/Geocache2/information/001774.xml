<center><b><i>Still south I went and west and south again,<br />
Through Wicklow from the morning till the night,<br />

I knew the stars, the flowers, and the birds,<br />
The grey and wintry sides of many glens,<br />

In converse with the mountains, moors, and fens.<br />

This is a very simple multi on one of the most popular hiking
mountains in Wicklow. It can be accessed from many directions
including Maulin and War Hill as indicated on the map above where I
have shown a good 4 hour hike in a circular fashion during which a
geocacher could pick up a number of super caches. The only stage
indicated on this illustration refers to this cache..<br />
Djouce can also be accessed from the JB Malone side as well as an
up and down hike from Crone car park without the circular
route.<br />
There was a cache here up to recently but it has now been archived
by Donnacha and he has kindly given me permission to replace it
with this one<br />
No matter which way you choose to do this cache, I would recommend
that you take the stroll of about 800 metres down, in the general
direction of War Hill to visit The Coffin Stone where I have placed
another cache. The stone is quite impressive and apparently some
bones were found beneath which indicated that it was a Megalithic
Portal Tomb. Amazing to think that such a place existed in the
distant past in such remote surroundings though the presence of
plenty of deer may help to explain that.<br />
For this cache you need to find Stage 1 which is very close to the
summit of Djouce. This is the only stage required to find the
coordinates for the cache. Call the date in the month that you see
"A" and call the age given "BC".<br />
The cache is not far away at N53 07.(ABC X 2) -69 W006 14.ABC -
85.<br />

From Mountain Views:<br />
Djouce Mountain Wicklow County Dioghais A name in Irish (Ir.
Dioghais [GE], 'fortified height') Height: 725 metres OS 1/50k
Mapsheet: 56 for top Grid Ref: O17858 10364 Latitude: 53.131066
Longitude: -6.239936 ITM: 717781 710395 Prominence: 200m Isolation:
1.4km Rating graphic. Djouce dominates the views of the Wicklow
Mountains from Roundwood and Newtown Mountkennedy. The Old Irish
word dígas is defined by the Dictionary of the Irish Language as
'high, lofty; a height'. There is a Sliab Digsa mentioned in the
Metrical Dindshenchas, where the second element is interpreted as a
woman's name. This shows that the meaning of dígas was already
obscure by the time of the Metrical Dindshenchas (12th century) and
a story was probably invented to account for the name. Djouce is
the 91st highest summit in Ireland. Our data has reached 100% of
the goal for this summit. (Details)<br />

Please observe the country code to the best of your ability. Local
landowners often generously allow access to upland areas across or
through parts of their private property. Please, please be

where appropriate but if you have to climb over them then use the

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-12T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />My 3rd and last WITG cache of the day. A short easy walk up from the Coffin Stone to the summit. Unusually there were sheep right at the summit, grazing around the rocky outcrop at the trig point. They had all been shorn and were painted red all over. Lovely enjoyable cache, then the long walk back down to the car. Thanks for yet another enjoyable and well-planned walk in the garden!</li><li>2010-05-27T19:00:00Z : Found it by didi2206 <br />Super day & super cache... Thanks!!</li><li>2010-05-18T19:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />Found with Shailaja on a windy & cloudy day at the summit. No views at all.
About a dozen guys from the Army were there having a lunch break. I wouldn't like to have been carrying the load they had on their backs.

Windy up top and we were a few minutes wandering around with conflicting coords until I spotted some stones and went digging! Very well hidden and I made sure I left it the same way.
