  <description><p>This cache will take you on a short walk in Terenure, the land
of the yew tree. There are three stages not far from each other and
a little bit of math involved. This is our first cache, so your
feedback is welcome :-)</p></description>
  <long-description>Honora was born far in the South,<br />
 in minutes her birthday will be unveiled. <br />
When Irish nation oppressed was so much, <br />
she learnt in France and when she came back <br />
was risking her head to pass knowledge round, <br />
then nursed poor sick people by dreadful nights. <br />
 
<p>The patron of this cache, whose middle name is Honora, was voted
Ireland's greatest woman. She was born in the 18th century in Co.
Cork, at the times when teaching Irish Roman Catholics was strictly
prohibited. Her family was wealthy enough to send her to France,
where she got her education. Soon after coming back to the Emerald
Island, she started her school with 30 girls, in a mud cabin of two
earthen-floored rooms. After school hours she would visit the poor,
the sick and the dying, thus she is often pictured as going about
with a lantern in one hand and a stick in the other. Her nick name
was Lady with the Lantern.</p>

<br />
 <br />
<p>The coordinates bring you to a wall with a sign in front of a
place of knowledge. You will need the <b>Irish text on the sign</b>
(26 letters) to find out who is the patron of this place and this
cache.</p>
<p>Play hopscotch with the sign, using the numbers below:</p>
<p>6-7-12-18---15-16-*-5-26.</p>
<p>Now, look across the street for an official lamp post with a
name on it. Take the first letter from that word to find the
missing * letter.</p>
Now, have a closer look at the sign on the wall and collect more
information: <br />
How many stars are on the logo on the sign? Call it A.<br />
How many Irish words are on the logo on the sign? Call it B. <br />
How many letters are in the 1st Irish word on the sign? Call it C.
<br />
How many letters g are in the Irish name on the sign? Call it D.
<br />
<p>The coordinates for the second location are <b>N53 18.609 W6
17.301</b>. They should give you a better view behind the
wall...</p>
<p>How many crosses can you see on the red brick building? Call it
E.</p>
<p>Now, a little bit of maths to find out the final coordinates :-)
Calculate the longitude first!</p>
006W 17.E(A/E)(C-1) 
<p>Now, some numerology for the latitude:</p>
53N 18.GBD 
<p>To get G, you need to divide the decimal part of the longitude
by the number of crosses. Call this number F. Now add up the digits
of number E and F to get G.<br />
<font color="#8B0000"><i>E.g. If your calculated westing was 006W
17.422 and there were 2 crosses, F would be 422/2 = 211 and G would
be 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6</i><br />
 The final coordinates will look "nice"...</font></p>
<p>The final location is in a green residential area where you can
spot many birds. Some of the birds nest in the hidden gardens of
"the place of knowledge". We have chosen the final cache location
to prevent any trouble with officials at the first stage. Hope you
will enjoy that short walk!</p></long-description>

I found all the items I was supposed to look for at stages 1 and 2 but the final coordinates made no sense. When acquiring the various numbers, I noticed that some of the things I was supposed to count were simply not there - giving me a count of zero and a lot of doubt. I will e-mail the owner and try to find out what is going on. Maybe something has changed in the area and the instructions are no longer correct.</li><li>2009-05-24T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Team ah-aah <br />My last day in Dublin without a GPS... found location, but no cache, it got dark so had to end hunt :O(
