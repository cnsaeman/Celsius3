This cache is one of six in the "Dublin's Railway Termini" series.
The full series, consisting of Westland Row, Amiens Street,
Kingsbridge, North Wall, Broadstone and Harcourt Street will bring
you to the railway termini, both past and present, of Dublin city
and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the vast railway
network that once served the city. Today the railway buildings
remain as impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities. While some of the buildings remain in use
as railway stations, others are sadly neglected relics of Dublin's
railway past. <br />
<br />
Inside the lid of each cache you will find 2 numbers printed in red
and white lettering. Gather all 12 numbers and you will be able to
ascertain the coordinates for an exclusive 7th cache relating to
Dublin's railway history. <br />
<br />
Dublin Connolly, previously named Amiens Street Station, is a focal
point in the Irish route network. The ornate station facade has a
distinctive Italianate tower at its centre. Situated on the north
side of the River Liffey, the station provides intercity and
commuter services to the north, northwest and south of the country.
The north-south Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) service also
passes through the station. The station offices serve as the
headquarters of the Irish Rail firm, Iarnród Éireann. <br />
<br />
The station was opened on 29 November 1844 by the Dublin &
Drogheda Railway Company as Dublin Station, but was renamed ten
years later as Amiens Street Station after the street on which it
is located. Originally the station only served a single mainline to
Drogheda, and only in 1853 did through services to Belfast
commence. In 1891 the City of Dublin Junction Railway connected the
station with Westland Row Station (now Pearse Station) on the
city's south side. The C of D Jctn was a separate station known as
Amiens St Junction and consisted of the present platforms 5,6 &
7 with a separate street entrance. After the amalgamation of the
GNR at the end of the 1950s this station became part of the overall
Amiens St and the separate entrance fell into disuse. The C of D
Jctn Rly. allowed services to run from Amiens St., through to
Westland Row, and onwards to Rosslare and the Southeast. Services
to Sligo were transferred to the station in 1937, with the closure
of Broadstone Station by CIÉ. Services to Galway and Mayo also
originated/terminated at Connolly Station after 1937, running via
Mullingar and Athlone. This was discontinued in the 1970s in favour
of running services out of Heuston Station on the better quality
Cork line. Passenger running between Mullingar/Athlone ceased
completely in 1987. <br />
<br />
In 1966, the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, the station's
name was changed to Connolly Station after Irish revolutionary and
socialist James Connolly. At the same time, several other main
stations in the Republic were renamed after patriots executed for
their roles in the Rising. <br />
<br />
At the commencement of DART services in 1984, the C of D Jctn Rly
entrance was refurbished and reopened for commuter traffic. <br />
<br />
During the late 1990s, Connolly Station was completely renovated
and partially rebuilt. An entirely new station hall was built, the
roof over Platforms 1-4 was replaced, and a new bar/cafe and shops
were installed. The former DART/Suburban station entrance (C of D
Jctn Rly entrance) and the secondary station hall built with the
DART (further north on Amiens St) were again closed, but a new
entrance on the International Financial Services Centre side was
opened. In 2004, the Luas Red Line (to Tallaght) began serving the
station. As part of the preparation for this, the ramp which had
been a bus terminus was demolished and replaced with a 2-platform
tram station connected to the main concourse by escalators and
lift. <br />
<br />
The cache is a magnetic micro. Please replace it as you found it,
ensuring it is not visible. Beware of possible watching eyes in
this area. GPS reception at the cache site may be poor, so you may
need the clue. <br />
