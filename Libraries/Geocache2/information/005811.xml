  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by slands <br />Initially I had put the wrong co-ords into my GPS, and ended up at another "Mossy". Spent a lot of time, and got lots of nettle stings checking all possible places around there. Just as I was about to give up, I double checked the co-ords on my phone, and found that I was 200M away from GZ [:I]

After re-setting my GPS I was off again. This time got to the right spot. Like others my GPS was all over the place at the site - probably not helped by all the wet trees around. After searching for a while decided to check the hint and spoiler...they did not really help much, apart from telling me which side of the track I should be searching on. It was raining heavily at this point, and I was just about to give up when I spotted it...very well hidden indeed. 

Note...it is fairly overgrown here now, so the "Mossy" referred to in the hint and spoiler photo is no longer obvious!
