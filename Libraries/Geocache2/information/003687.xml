  <long-description>In 1539, King Henry VIII awarded the Monkstown lands to Sir John
Travers, Master of the Ordnance in Ireland. John Travers lived in
his Castle at Monkstown from 1557 to his death in 1562 and buried
in the Carrickbrennan graveyard where the property fell to James
Eustace 3rd Viscount Baltinglass through his marriage to Mary
Travers. In 1580, the Castle was used as a rebellion stronghold
when it was awarded to Sir Henry Wallop the Vice Treasurer of
Ireland. The lands were later returned to Mary, widow Baltinglass
who later married Gerald Alymer. On her death in 1610 the Castle
was transferred to the Chevers family through the marriage of Mary
Travers's sister Catherine to John Chevers, and the property passed
directly to his second son Henry Chevers, who married Catherine,
daughter of Sir Richard Fitzwilliam. Henry and Catherine Chevers
lived with their four children (Walter, Thomas, Patrick, Margaret).
Upon the death of Henry in 1640, the castle and lands were passed
to Walter Cheevers. Walter and family were given command to vacate
Monkstown in 1653 by the Cromwellian Commissioners, and
transplanted to Killyan, County Galway. In 1660, Walter Cheevers
was restored to his estate at Monkstown Castle, until his death in
1678. Monkstown was later purchased by Bishop of Armagh Michael
Boyle where his son enlarged the castle making it one of the finest
residences. The Shivers family of America trace their lineage to
Thomas Chevers brother of Walter Chevers of Monkstown, through the
Cromwellian warrant, authorized on 26 November 1653 for Captain
John Whittey to transport the Thomas Chevers family to America.
