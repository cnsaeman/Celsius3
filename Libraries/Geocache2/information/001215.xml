<p>The Millennium Park, Blanchardstown caters for both passive and
active recreation. Passive recreational is facilitated through a
network of pedestrian footpaths through tree-lined avenues,
wildflower meadowland, both formal and themed gardens, woodland
areas, and with seating areas throughout the park. Active
recreational facilities include football pitches to the north-east
of the site as well as two all-weather surface areas and a
substantial junior and senior playground. Parking is accessable
from the park entrance at the Snugborough Road Extension.</p>
