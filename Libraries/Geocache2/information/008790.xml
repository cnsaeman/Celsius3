<br />
This walk is not in Wicklow but it is in an area which is well
known by many South Dubliners as the gateway to the Wicklow
mountains. It is worthy of the "Garden" title anyhow as it is very
similar territory to much of Wicklow. The coordinates above are for
the start of a walking trail which changes to open mountain
moorland and it is not long at 5.5K with a total ascent of just
140m. You may need to see this cache information on a PC or
similar! There is just about room for 1 car at the above
coordinates but up and down the road within a short distance there
are several more likely spots. Along the trail, on a clear day,
there are some excellent and varied views of the city and a lovely
vista down the length of Glencullen from Glendoo. You are likely to
be treated to an orchestra of larksong all around both tops of
Glendoo.<br />
This is an easier hike (and cache) than most in this series but the
ground underfoot can be quite sloppy in places so good waterproof
boots are needed if there has been any rain. If you are fortunate
enough to do this walk after a dry spell you would not need
gaiters, otherwise they are highly recommended! ADVISABLE TO AVOID
DURING THE DEPTHS OF WINTER!<br />

<br />
Work out the puzzle to get the coords for Stage 1 (N53 and W006 are
a given, ok?). There you will find 3 numbers (ABC) which you will
need to use in the following formula to work out the first part of
the final coordinates.<br />
<br />
<br />
N53 13.BA(C-6).<br />
<br />
After Stage 1 continue on the trail to N53 13.618 W006 18.198 where
the trail forks to the left on to a narrower, more rugged path.
Follow this to N53 13.848 W006 17.971 where there is a large gap in
the fence. Turn right immediately after the gap and cross some
rough terrain toward another fence and follow it to Stage 2.<br />
<br />
The second part of the final coordinates are at Stage 2 N53 13.979
W006 17.786.<br />
When you have the full coords follow around the corner of the fence
and down toward N53 13.986 W006 17.662 where you will meet a bog
path which will take you along another fence all the way up to
Glendoo.<br />
<br />
After retrieving the cache, the shortest route back is via
Glendoo's "second top" where you need to head for N53 13.496 W006
17.804. The ground is pretty damp and boggy on the way down the
slight slope and the start of the path may appear rough at these
coords but it soon becomes the trail that started you off and it is
a very simple walk back down to the start.<br />

which is extremely difficult to solve. so there is a risk
involved.<br />
<br />
Please observe the country code to the best of your ability. Local
landowners often generously allow access to upland areas across or
through parts of their private property. Please, please be
conscious of this and return the courtesy by keeping all gates
closed, immediately and not on your way back!. Please use the gates
where appropriate but if you have to climb over them then use the
hinged side ONLY.<br />
Please do not cause any damage of any sort to fences or barriers
along the way.<br /></font></font></long-description>

I have most of them worked out but just waiting for some decent weather to get out there and grab them. Needless to say the recent snow made this terrain a lot more than 2.5 but I enjoyed every minute of it...thigh deep snow, mud filled boots, stunning views, sure what more would you want.

This certainly makes good practice for the tougher caches in the series...maybe even one day I will add the dreaded #1 to my belt. I can only dream!!!

TFTC now I am going to reward myself with a well earned ice cold beer!

Jamie</li><li>2009-10-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />A short enough walk, but not too pleasant - once we got on the open mountain it was pretty windy and rainy. 
We parked at Cruagh road - probably a safer bet than on the road.</li><li>2009-10-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by Donnacha <br />Found with Fjon. Lots of wind and rain on the way up and it was quite boggy. Nice walk, thanks.</li><li>2009-08-01T19:00:00Z : Found it by toczygroszek <br />Simple puzzle but cache not so easy. Stage 1 was the hardest part. Both stages 1 and 2 are accesible for bicycle, but final oocation only when you push it [:D] TFTC!</li></ul></logs>
