This cache is one of six in the "Dublin's Railway Termini" series.
The full series, consisting of Westland Row, Amiens Street,
Kingsbridge, North Wall, Broadstone and Harcourt Street will bring
you to the railway termini, both past and present, of Dublin city
and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the vast railway
network that once served the city. Today the railway buildings
remain as impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities. While some of the buildings remain in use
as railway stations, others are sadly neglected relics of Dublin's
railway past. <br />
<br />
Inside the lid of each cache you will find 2 numbers printed in red
and white lettering. Gather all 12 numbers and you will be able to
ascertain the coordinates for an exclusive 7th cache relating to
Dublin's railway history. <br />
<br />
The main railway terminus for the Midlands Great Western Railways
was located at Broadstone on the north side of the city. It was
designed by J. Mulvany and is of a neo-Egyptian style and
constructed of granite. Completed in 1850, train services from
Broadstone remained until the late 1950's when it was closed to
make way for a bus depot. The main building is intact today, though
in a derelict condition. In fact it is not even connected to the
rail network and its forecourt is a surface carpark. Sited on a
hill, its most dramatic feature is its railway shed with its huge
colonnade of columns. <br />
<br />
The original railway shed roof designed by Richard Turner proved to
be too ambitious for the span and was replaced after it collapsed
in the early 1850s. Originally there was a canal spur from the
Royal Canal to a basin in front of the station. <br />
<br />
Just eleven years after the station was built extensive alterations
were made to the terminus, including the erection of the beautiful
colonnade. As the "Freeman" newspaper stated: "Today or tomorrow
the alterations which have been for some months in course of
preparation, come into effect at Broadstone Terminus. To avoid the
inconvenience and possible dangers of changing rails as hitherto in
leaving or arriving the trains were compelled to do, the platforms
have been altered from one side of the building to the other. The
south-west will, in future, be the departure side, the north-east
the arrival; the travellers leaving Dublin passing the front of the
terminus and reaching this platform by a handsome collonade,
supported with metal pillars, and through a spacious ticket office.
On this the departure platform will now be found with waiting rooms
and in an additional storey the offices of the traffic manager,
engineer, the auditor, also spare rooms, suitable for branch
company's uses, all to the number of nine, opening on a corridor
300 feet in length." <br />
<br />
"On the opposite side the arrival platform has now been formed. It
opens on a magnificent collonade, about fifty feet in width by 600
feet in length. This is appropriated to vehicles of every
description, which can leave its inclosure with the utmost
celerity. The alterations are decided improvements. They have, we
understand, been carried out under the supervision of Mr C
Wilkinson, of Westland-row. The interior of the station is being
further beautified by the painting in bright colours of the roof,
pillars and delicate iron work of the spacious and graceful shed -
the building, altogether, presenting a railway terminus in every
way worthy of a great and enterprising company". <br />
<br />
In June 2007 Iarnrod Eireann announced plans to re-open Broadstone
Station in 2010 to facilitate north inner city commuters. It's
estimated the station will cater for over 5,000 commuters per hour.

It's been fun to look for this series all over the city it's just a pity we didn't find the one near Pearse Station or we could have completed the series and find the bonus. Thanks for the walk through Dublin's Railway History anyway.
