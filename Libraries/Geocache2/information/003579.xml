Lucan Bridge is a road bridge spanning the River Liffey in the
village of Lucan in County Dublin.. It joins Lucan's Main Street to
the Lower Lucan Road, carrying traffic towards Clonsilla and the
north.<br>
The bridge is the largest single span masonry arch bridge in
Ireland, and is constructed from ashlar masonry with a span of 110
feet (33 meters) and a rise of 22 feet (6.7 meters). It is framed
by iron balustraded parapets made by the Royal Phoenix ironworks of
Parkgate Street in Dublin.<br>
Architected by George Knowles (architect of Dublin's Fr. Mathew and
O'Donovan Rossa Bridges), it was built in 1814 in collaboration
with James Savage to replace several previous bridges which were
carried away by floods.<br>
The first bridge built on this spot was a stone bridge laid down in
the later years of the reign of King John (c.1200). A subsequent
bridge was built by the first Agmondisham Vesey c.1730, but washed
away within very short time. The next was built c.1771, but this
too washed away in a flood in 1786 - as did it's replacement.<br>
In 1814, the present single span bridge was completed by Savage
& Knowles, and has remained largely unaffected by the effects
of flooding common to this stretch of the Liffey. The bridge
however has seen some recent developments, with the raising of the
roadway near both ends of the arch to lessen the gradient for road
traffic.<br>
<br>
It is not uncommon to see anglers carrying big salmon from the
river below. On bright summer days local children use the weir area
below for picnicking, swimming and boating.</long-description>
