  <long-description><p>The Velvet Strand is a long sandy beach, approximately 5 km in
length, consisting of a large sandy dune area.</p>
<p>It was from here, on June 24th. 1930 that the Southern Cross,
piloted by Sir Charles Kingsford Smith with Irishman, Captain Paddy
Saul as navigator, flew to Newfoundland on what was the second ever
airplane flight across the Atlantic from East to West.</p>
<p>On August 18th. 1932, Jim Mollison, husband of an equally famous
woman pilot, Amy Johnson, also left the Velvet Strand in his De
Havilland Puss Moth aircraft, The Heart's Content, to attempt the
first solo, non-stop East to West crossing of the Atlantic. His aim
was to get to New York and his fuel capacity of 160 gallons ensured
him of 33 hours continuous flying. However, heavy headwinds forced
him to land 30 hours later at Pennfield Ridge, about 30 miles from
Saint John, New Brunswick in Canada. He slept in the Admiral Beatty
Hotel in Saint John and, the next day, returned to Pennfield to fly
his Puss Moth out to the newly constructed Millidgeville airfield
(1930) where he refuelled and took off again for New York on August
20th. This flight was acclaimed throughout the World and what
cynics had viewed as a foolish venture had, in fact, become a
reality. .</p>
<p>The contours of Portmarnock strand change constantly during the
year as sand is moved to and fro by storms and wind. Extra beach
has been created at the southern end of the beach. A feature over
the last few years has been the deterioration of the sand dunes
behind the strand. .</p>
