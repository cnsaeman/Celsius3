  <long-description><p>Malahide Estuary stretches from Malahide eastwards to
Swords.<br />
The outer part of the estuary is mostly cut off from the sea by a
large sand spit, known as "the island”. It drains almost completely
at low tide, exposing sand and mud flats.<br />
This estuary is an important wintering bird site where a number of
birds can be seen including Brent Geese, Great Crested Grebe, Mute
Swan, Shelduck, Pochard, Red-breasted Merganser, Oystercatcher, And
Golden Plover.</p>
<p>The Brent population is of international importance. The high
numbers of diving birds reflects the lagoon-type nature of the
inner estuary. The head of the estuary, traditionally known as
Swords estuary, holds a large flock of Mute Swans which have been
studied for many years as part of a research programe on the swans
of County Dublin.</p>
<p>Many of them have white numbered rings on their legs. Indeed,
Mute Swans ringed in Dublin as part of this program have been seen
as far east as Wales, as far south as Wexford and as far west as
Cork.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The Cache is a small micro container please re-hide it well to
prevent the many muggles from discovering it.</p>
