  <long-description>Sidetracked-Phoenix Park.

Nice easy micro which may only be approached from the car park above the platform area. No need to enter the station proper or access any platforms.

This brand new local station on the Western line was originally part of Bertie Ahern's ambitious, or foolhardy plan to build his famous "Bowl" stadium. The plan received a quick death as soon as it was realised that all the funds generated by the sporadic Celtic Tiger were being systematically chucked at too many other white elephants and laboriously delayed infrastructural projects and needlessly wasteful tribunal cover ups, to leave anything tangible.
In the end the only reasonable thing to come out of it was this new station which is designed to cater for all the new apartment housing being constructed on the Phoenix Park Racecourse land. 
Perhaps it is cynical to mention that the existing and improved Ashtown station is barely 500 yards down the line/road.

The station is on the Dublin - Sligo railway line (see Rail transport in Ireland), located between Ashtown railway station and Castleknock railway station. The station is adjacent to the Navan Road (the N3 road), between the roundabout at the junction of Castleknock Road and Ashtown Road and the roundabout at the junction of Auburn Avenue and New Dunsink Lane. The station was built by the developers of the Phoenix Park Racecourse Apartments (built, as their name implies on the site of the old Phoenix Park racecourse) although the station itself is neither on the grounds of the former racecourse nor the Phoenix Park proper. Access to the station is via a grade-separated junction off the N3.

[edit] Design and Services

Similar to both Dun Laoghaire railway station and Leixlip Louisa Bridge railway station, the station building is on the bridge that connects the two platforms. From here there are lifts and stairs down to each platform.

The station is served by Western Commuter services. Both main services (westbound to Maynooth and Longford and eastbound to Dublin city centre and Docklands branch services (from Clonsilla to Docklands) call at the station. InterCity services do not call at the station, although one can interchange at either Maynooth or Dublin Connolly railway station.</long-description>
