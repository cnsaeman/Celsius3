  <description>Located along the Wicklow way at the viewing point of Powerscourt Waterfall and Crone Woods. Near the wall but not IN the wall</description>
  <long-description>[Please note this cache is hidden near an old wall. Please dont pull bricks from the wall or disturb the wall in any way because it is not hidden within the wall structure] 

The Amazing Grace Geocache is named after my mum Grace. We used to go to Powercourt regularly just on days out as Mother and Son. 

After her passing and thanks to the forest owners I have got a memorial seat located on the trail overlooking Powercourt Waterfall. Please take your time to sit and admire the view. The cache is a Pelican box located close by.

I ask for one thing as the owner of this cache and the seat, please respect the seat, please report any damage to it or the nearby Geocache and I hope you enjoy this beautiful location.

To get there travel to Enniskerry, then to Powercourt Waterfall, head towards Crone Car Park and start from the car park. The car park is open until 4pm.</long-description>
