  <description>Hidden Along the Wicklow Way near Knockree Youth Hostel.</description>
  <long-description>Knockree is situated in a wonderful tranquil position, right on the Wicklow Way and commands superb views of Glencree and the mountains that ring it. 

Enniskerry, is 7 kilometres from the Knockree, is one of the prettiest villages in Ireland, lying in a wooded hollow among the hills west of Bray. Nearby are Powerscourt demesne and the Glen of the Dargle. 

The cache was hidden by the Troop 44 Scouts along the Wicklow Way. Enjoy the beauty as you walk alongside the River Dargle and try and find our cache location.

The cache is an ammo box which could be hidden in several locations. After you find where we have hidden it, please take your time to try and disguise it in the same fashion!

For tourists to Ireland, this is an ideal cache if you are staying in Knockree Hostel. It is litterally 10 minutes walk away!

If you are continuing the Wicklow Way, dont forget to check out the Paddock Hill Cache, another one of my caches!</long-description>
  <encoded-hints>If you have a good GPS, you wont need a hint for this one. Its a regular size cache inside!</encoded-hints>
