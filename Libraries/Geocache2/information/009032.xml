  <logs><ul><li>2009-10-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by GerIRL <br />So 2+ years after figuring this one out, I finally got to visit GZ today with my Mom who drove me out from Castleknock.  Very nice location.  We spent about 30 minutes looking before coming up trumps with the container.  Cache is in good shape.  After replacing, we went inside for a few minutes.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache.</li><li>2008-12-05T20:00:00Z : Owner Maintenance by Windsockers <br />Second container removed and also found a third weird </li><li>2008-11-01T19:00:00Z : Found it by toczygroszek <br />After brainstorming with Dara we had few ideas. But finally he was right I was wrong. My point was only find promising location in few possibilities. After Dara's log i knew exactly where cache is.
It was 1st cache of day, found in five minuter searching. But 2nd wasn't to far from there. When I found container inside were only Kili's and Hezekiah's logs. Especially no Dara's log, it was strange. Call to him and short conversation. He told me where he found container. And yes, I found 2nd container, about 1,5 m below 1st!

I made a breakthrough in May 2007, that yielded a large number of possible locations. Since then I have revisited the problem every so often, but failed to find a unique solution.

Brainstorming with toczygroszek, I shared my discoveries to date, and he pointed out that one of the possible locations looked promising. I visited there tonight, torch in hand, and spent 30 minutes searching before happening upon the cache. Thanks for an entertaining and infuriating cache!</li><li>2008-06-14T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />What a nasty cache! 
Not only is it a dastardly puzzle, but when I got to the actual location, more or less, I realised it was far from over.
I tried quite a few various combinations of co-ords, and one was quite obviously the right one. However, I still spent about 30 minutes poking around near the hiding place, scratching my hands and arms in the process. Finally, almost by chance I dislodged the container and managed to sign the log. </li></ul></logs>
