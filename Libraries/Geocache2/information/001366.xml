  <description>My first Irish cache.</description>
  <long-description>I am of Irish heritage and would love to visit the country some
day. If everything stays on track I should be there sometime in the
next few years. Then I can visit this site myself. Other things on
the short list is to visit the St. James' Gate Brewery and walk the
yellow footsteps of Bloom through Dublin.
