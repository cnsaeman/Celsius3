  <description>Dublin&rsquo;s Phoenix Park is a treasure with more than 1700 acres
of walled parkland just 3km from the centre of the city.
<p>At 707 hectares (1752 acres) is one of the largest enclosed
recreational spaces within any European capital city.<br /></p></description>

<p><br />
There are some thirty-eight lodges with living accommodation
situated within Phoenix Park and no two dwellings are of the same
design.</p>
<p>The wall is itself designated as a protected structure and
stretches the entire way around the present-day park. It is eleven
kilometres long and three metres high. The wall also supports its
own particular flora.<br />
The park is open all year round, there is no admission charge and
visitors can explore freely.</p>
<p>Bus Route(s): No's 10, 25, 37, 38, 39, 66, 67 from city
centre.</p>
<p>Each of the vehicular gates into Phoenix Park has a
gatekeeper&rsquo;s lodge as part of the entrance cluster.<br /></p>

The cache is a tabloc box but so. Stealth required.<br /></p></long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-11T19:00:00Z : Found it by Maji <br />Finally! & lessons re-learnt.
Lesson 1 : plan your time carefully. Don't go when there's something on (no, not Bloom) and marshalls directing traffic at the gate.
Lesson 2 : Don't go back after deleting the co-ords off your gps from the previous visit.
Lesson 3 : Read the log entry so you're not looking for a magnetic micro when its a small tabloc.
Lesson 4: And don't assume its in the obvious place(s). Sometimes, they only become obvious after you've found them!
Last one of the series (unless you're planning NCR gate?)
