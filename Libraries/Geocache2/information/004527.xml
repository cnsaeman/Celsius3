  <description>The fifth of 6 caches along the Howth Cliff Walk.</description>

<br />
The Howth Cliff Walk offers the walker a fine, varied walk around
an open hillside and the Howth cliffs, with the guarantee of
plentiful bird life, excellent sea views and colourful wild
flowers.<br />
<br />
The walk can be commenced at many different places along the route,
with many easy access points from various car parks that are
conveniently located close to the path. This caching trail
commences at the car park 1km to the east of the village (N53
23.137 W6 03.048) and moves slowly south, then west, but can also
be undertaken in a reverse order.<br />
<br />
While the main walk is generally not very steep, a couple of caches
may require some scrambling up brief stretches of steep terrain. As
always in Ireland it is advised to bring along good waterproof
clothing for the inevitable shower. Sturdy footware is also a must.
If you wish to undertake the entire walk in one go it makes sense
to bring a packed lunch and plenty of liquids, as the full journey
may take in the region of 4-5 hours.<br />
<br />
This cache is located on the beach beside Drumleck Point. There is
a clear path down to the beach, but care is needed to reach it.
Also, this cache becomes less easily accessible when the tide comes
in, so please try to time your visit around the tide being
out.<br />
<br />
Apparently this beach was formerly a private beach, owned by the
Jameson family (the whiskey people). The gate at the top of the
path was their private entrance to the beach. Nearby is the remains
of a swimming pool which the family had constructed. (Thanks to
Moonshiner Extraordinaire for this additional info!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;The cache is hidden under a small rock. Please replace the
cache so that it is not visible.</p></long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-30T19:00:00Z : Found it by SharpSwords <br />Nice one along the cliffs. We felt like we were in an adventure movie of Indiana Jones! We had a little picnic and play on the beach! We had loads of fun and we climbed a lot. Jake climbed up over the top of a cave and jumped down the other side! We saw some muggles but they didnt see what we were doing!  [:D] [8D] [;)] [:o)]</li><li>2010-05-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by tmob <br />#2408

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Our second, and last cache of the series. It was getting late, and we were getting tired; but we were curious to return one day.
We didn't knew we needed to go down to the beach, but i happy we went [:D]

Thanks for this one...
