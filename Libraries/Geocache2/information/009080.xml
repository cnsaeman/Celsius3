ok, so the cache itself is not all that fancy, but it is situated
on top of The Fancy Mountain, or Luggala, as it is also known. From
the summit there are wonderful view of Lough Tay and the Guinness
Estate in the valley below. The drive from Dublin to the cache
along the Military Road is a great way to see the beauty of the
Wicklow Mountains and is recommended.The mountain can be climbed
without much difficulty and in about an hour from the car park at
N53 07.060 W6 18.105. From there there's a fairly obvious path to
the summit. Once at the summit the view on the valley below is
breathtaking, though caution is to be taken due to the steep cliffs
on the eastern side of the mountain. The cache is situated well
back from the cliffs, so it is not neccessary to approach them.
Hopefully it shouldn't be too hard to find the cache, but it might
be a good idea to bring a copy of the cache spoiler photo.<br />
<br />
Update: 19-10-04 - I developed the pictures from the disposble
camera and uploaded them. I'm not sure who's in which photo, so if
you see yourself in any of them, please let me know!</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-03-14T19:00:00Z : Owner Maintenance by Bootle <br />Stopped by on a glorious March day to replace this old cache with a much smaller one. The views are great here on a clear day!</li><li>2009-09-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by Prefontaine <br />First cache of the day. We brought some friends with us who been geocaching with us last year but were dying to go again. I wanted to climb this mountain and see the amazing views from its summit. We didn't follow the obvious path to the summit and instead went up the side of the first hill. The terrain was less boggy here than going up the obvious path.

Found the cache, but it needs some maintenance. The plastic bag covering the cache was all torn and there was a lot of damp and moss inside the cache. We had an extra plastic bag which we used to cover the cache and hopefully keep it dry.

We had great views of Lough Tay and Lough Dan in the distance. We loved it up here.

 </li><li>2009-08-30T19:00:00Z : Found it by toczygroszek <br />Weather forecast wasn't look so bad as real weather [:D] Another bicycle trip to mountains - not exactly to cache location but only 2 km to it.
Cache found easily. I don't know who placed chocolate bars and jar of soup (or something like that) but is bad idea. Took out all food and some other rotten items. Better container for this location will be good.
Not too much views on the top, because fog covered everything. Great spot, anyway. TFTC!</li><li>2009-07-26T19:00:00Z : Found it by kaputing <br />First on a walk that was just too long, on the path wasn't quite there, or the rain just came a little too much. 17km from Pier Gates to Fancy to Djouce to JB memorial to pier gates. Stunning but heavy underfoot.
This cache however was just a joy.
Left a note, took a man.
