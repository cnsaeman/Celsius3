  <long-description><p><b>Letterboxing</b> is an outdoor hobby that combines elements
of orienteering, art and puzzle solving. Letterboxers hide small,
weatherproof boxes in publicly-accessible places (like parks) and
distribute clues to finding the box in printed catalogs, on one of
several web sites, or by word of mouth. Individual letterboxes
usually contain a logbook and a rubber stamp. Finders make an
imprint of the letterbox's stamp on their personal logbook, and
leave an impression of their personal stamp on the letterbox's
logbook&mdash;as proof of having found the box. Many letterboxers
keep careful track of their "find count".<br />
Modern-day letterboxing's origins can be traced to Dartmoor,
England in 1854. William Crossing in his Guide to Dartmoor states
that a well known Dartmoor guide (James Perrott) placed a bottle
for visitors cards at Cranmere Pool on the northern moor in 1854.
From this hikers on the moors began to leave a letter or postcard
inside a box along the trail (sometimes addressed to themselves,
sometimes a friend or relative)&mdash;hence the name
"letterboxing". The next person to discover the site would collect
the postcards and mail them. The first Dartmoor letterboxes were so
remote and well-hidden that only the most determined walkers ended
up finding them, allowing weeks to pass before the letter made its
way home. Increasingly, however, letterboxes have been located in
relatively accessible sites. As a result, the tradition of leaving
a letter or postcard in the box has been forgotten.<br />
Clues to the locations of Dartmoor letterboxes are traditionally
distributed in print format in the Dartmoor 100 Club's
regularly-updated catalogue. Letterboxes can be found in other
areas of the United Kingdom including the North York Moors and have
now spread all over the world.<br />
Interest in letterboxing in the U.S. is generally considered to
have started with a feature article in the Smithsonian Magazine in
April 1998. The growing popularity of the somewhat similar activity
of geocaching during the 2000's has increased interest in
letterboxing as well. Clues to American letterboxes are commonly
published on Letterboxing North America, Atlas Quest, and other
websites.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>This is a multi cache with a twist better known as a LETTER BOX
HYBRID cache.</p>
<p>Since this is a hybrid letterbox cache there is minimal use of
your GPS unit. you will need to combine the use of your GPS and
basic navigational skills, along with your geocaching skills to
locate the cache.</p>
<p>At the listed coordinates you will see a trail into the woods
this should be on your righthand side as you come up the
hill.<br />
Follow this trail for approximatly 80 meters till you come to a
minor trail, take the trail going to the left. Follow this traill
till you come to the end of the stone wall.<br />
With your back to the stone wall walk 32 paces in a straight line
into the woods the cache is located at this point.</p>
<p>The Cache is a decon box containing a rubber stamp.<br />
This cache also contains the entry point into the forest for its
sister cache A Shady stroll in the Night. Please take care and
rehide the cache to prevent muggles from discovering its
location.</p>
<b><font color="red">PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE either the information
for the second cache or therubber stamp.</font></b><br />
