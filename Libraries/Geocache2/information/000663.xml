  <long-description><p>Balrothery was an administrative centre for the Norman's, which
accounts for its present name, Baile na Ridire (Town of the
Knights). The knights of Fingal used to attend meetings in
Balrothery to discuss land and Church disputes. Balrothery Village
became the centre of the great Barony of Balrothery, which covered
most of North Fingal. .</p>
<p>In the mid 18th Century, Balrothery had a population of over
4,500 people and boasted a chair factory, two breweries and two
biscuit factories. The biscuits from these factories were ships
biscuits, and were greatly favoured by the British Navy as they
stayed crisp and fresh for a very long period of time. Nelson
demanded Balrothery biscuits for his ships.</p>
<p>On the western side of the Belfast Road through Balrothery,
there is a large Celtic cross erected over a mass grave of the
unfortunate paupers who perished in the workhouse which was
situated along the Balrothery "straight" until recent times.</p>

Found it very easily, but did feel slightly disrespectful.
A family of ants have moved into cache container and I think they are eating the log, which is disintegrating.
