  <long-description>The above Co-ordinates are not exact and are for reference only,
you will need to complete the Puzzle below to obtain the correct
co-ordinates.<br />
<br />
 
<p>There's right-of-way access to this cache site via a designated
entrance beside a closed gate, there is also an area to park your
car close by.<br />
Please do not bring dogs onto the site as there maybe horses
grazing from time to time.<br />
Please do not post "Spoilers" which might indicate the cache's
location in your Logs, as this will ruin the Puzzle and the game
for others. However, close-up photos won't do any harm I'm
sure.</p>
<p><b>The Puzzle</b><br />
Below is a magic number square. What makes this square
<font color="#0000FF"><b>"Magic"</b></font>?<br />
Well I'll tell you; the numbers in each row, colum, and main
diagonal lines have the same sum (65).<br />
When the square is complete, the entries will consist of the
numbers 1 through to 25,<br />
with no duplicate numbers, and as I've already said, the common sum
will be 65.</p>

<font color="#FF00FF">(E4xC4)+E3<br />
x: Multiple within the brackets first, then add where
required.</font></b></p>
<p>I have forced a <i>single solution</i> to the puzzle by placing
ten numbers in the square, so don't move them.<br />
Good Luck!<br />
