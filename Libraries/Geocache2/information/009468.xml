  <description>A summer cache on Ireland's Eye</description>
  <long-description>Ireland's Eye is an island about 1.2 miles (2 K) off Howth - a peninsula to the east of Dublin.  In past years it was actually a leper colony!  From Howth you can see the island's most prominent feature which is a martello tower.  Less obvious is the remains of an 8th century  church.

There is ample parking areas although you might want to get to them early as Howth is a very popular seaside resort.  You can get to the island by boat (N53 23.538 W006 03.810)from the east pier, €15 for adults and €10 for children - children by law must wear a lifejacket!  On your way to the boat, check out the OSI geodetic marker on one of the mooring bollards at N53 23.393 W006 03.804 - nobody else is interested in them!

Once on the island, lease be aware that in the spring, the seagulls can be agressive towards what they see as a threat to their nests and may "dive bomb" people.  Do NOT disturb any nests - the island is a bird sanctuary! Be careful not to trod on them either. There are a number of seals and dozens of comorants as well as others who spend leisure time here as well.  Please look but do not disturb.

You can make your way to the cache a number of ways.  Pick one that suits yourself.  The terrain is not difficult or dangerous for the most part but do watch your footing, especially near the cache, and depending on where you go.  The cache area might not be suitable for very small children unless supervised. Be aware that fern in autumn is considered dangerous to health.  The cache contained $1 note, fridge thermometer, a 1/2 dollar coin that has been made into a badge, a geocaching badge, marine style keyring.

More details can be found about Ireland's Eye through a quick search on Google.</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2009-08-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by feargalf <br />Co-find with fitzet & fitzeens.

Spectacular location for cache. Took some time to locate, but it was worth it.
TFTC</li><li>2009-08-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />Success!  Joint find with Feargalf (and fitzeens). It was a beautiful day today and the island was quite busy.  We went over the summit and so brought the kids almost to the cache site and left them parked while we scrambled around looking under rocks.  This was a very active nesting site and many of the rocks had egg shells under them where birds had hatched out.  Having seen where the cache is hidden I really don't think you could do this during nesting time in June and July - the parents would be very defensive!

However in August they are all gone and there was no divebombing.  We found the cache (first log for 2009) and were just thrilled to get the tractor bug out where it has been languishing for a year. We will place it in a busy cache tomorrow and let it carry on its journey.

In:  Zombie finger toy, bulging eyed skeleton keyring
Out:  Little sewing set, wrist band

TFTC-SL</li><li>2009-07-10T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Fitzet <br />Went to Irelands Eye today.  Really wanted to find the cache and move on that travel bug that has been there for a year! We got the ferry over which was 40 euro for a family of four which is pretty good value these days. We started on the wrong side of the island though and went to the summit first for a picnic and that gave us probably less time than we needed.  We couldn't get down the other side of the summit with the kids so had to return to our starting point and work from there.  Eventually Mr Fitz abandoned us and set out on his own and got very very close but was under serious attack by gulls and then almost stepped on a nest with a nestling in it (hence the attacks).  He decided to beat a retreat before any damage was done.  We will go back in August when the babies have fledged and hopefully we will get to it then.</li><li>2008-07-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by jilola <br />Found after being worried about seagulls. Good thing it wasn't nesting season!

I would never have gone there were it not for a cache.
