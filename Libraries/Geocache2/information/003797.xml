  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-08T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />This was a 'Windsockers' themed day of cache finds around the airport.  This was #7 of 7.  

We stopped at stage 2 for a well earned beverage.  Pub themed caches are great!  The final location was very interesting too, thanks for bringing us here.

SL TFTC</li><li>2010-04-20T19:00:00Z : Found it by dsquaredd2 <br />After a very long hike 2 days ago to collect the information, we collected it at during the biggest caching day for D2D2 today with a cache run with the owner, Windsockers! We went on a circuit beginning with Newgrange and ending in the Skerries finding and maintaining caches. A fun day, each location was unique. I was standing right there when I made the first lap. Man! This was the twenty-fourth. TFTC!
