The map above indicates 5 caches that are virtually "in a row". It
is quite a walk to get all of them but on a summer day it would be
nice. You can of course come back down to the Military Road at many
points along the way and if you decide to do the lot then you would
have a long road walk back to a car. There is a newer car park at
the exit from the mountains at Carrigshouk. With a car parked at
either end a group could manage this quite well.<br />
<br />
You can park at N53 07.052 W 006 18.110 or at any spot along the
Military Road at the Sally gap area that you can or that you feel
is appropriate. Not too many clear ways up to this and the terrain
is tough enough but there are rough trails. Good water proof boots
are a must and gaiters would be good. Weather very changeable and
clouds can roll in pretty quickly so compass and map (Discovery
Series No. 56) essential. Scenery is lovely so well worth the
effort.<br />
<br />
Good idea to do this at the same time as Carrigvore as you can save
yourself some energy.<br />
The cache is in a rock formation 52 paces from the summit at a
bearing of 200 degrees.<br />

Thanks for the cache!</li><li>2009-10-17T19:00:00Z : Write note by Kili or bust <br />Just a name change to tie in with the rest of the series.</li><li>2009-08-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by Prefontaine <br />Second cache find of the day. We found this one after a successful find on Carrigvore. When we were on the summit of Carrigvore it looked like an ok trek to Gravale but met a group of hikers who advised us that it was very boggy and difficult to trek through!!

Our advice it to watch out for the hidden gaps in the bogs. Made it to the summit just before the weather started to turn bad and so we had to cancel having lunch on the summit. 

Found cache very easily as it was a little exposed but we made sure to place some more rocks around it to keep it secure and not exposed to mugglers. We headed back in a more direct route to Military Road and walked from there back to the car as we didn't fancy backtracking our route through all the bogs and up to Carrigvore.

Trip in the mountains was cut short by an approaching rain front which drove us back to the car.
The box was easy to open but not so easy to close again as it was brimming with stuff :) After some practice we managed to put everything in and replaced the box in its hide.
