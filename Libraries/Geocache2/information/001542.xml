<b>Morton Stadium, or the National Athletics Stadium</b>, is an
athletics stadium in Santry, in the north of Dublin City. Often
called Santry Stadium, it is the centre for athletics events in
Ireland, and home track of Clonliffe Harriers. It is currently home
to Sporting Fingal FC. The modern capacity of the ground is 4,000
with a single 800 seat, covered stand.

<p style="text-align:left">The stadium was opened in 1958 with a
cinder track. An inaugural series of meetings was held, and on 6
August 1958, Australian Herb Elliott shattered the world record for
the mile with a time of 3 minutes 54.5 seconds. This was the first
race in which five athletes had run a four minute mile. Gillian
O&lsquo;Sullivan set a world record for the 5000m walk 20.02.60 in
2002. Olympian, Paul Hession, set a new Irish 200m Record of 20.30
seconds at the 2007 Track and Field Championships. In the same
year, Kilkenny&rsquo;s Eileen O&rsquo;Keeffe completed a
world-class throw of 73.21 meters in the Morton Stadium- a new
Irish Record.</p>
<p><br />
In 1978 the stadium was resurfaced with a tartan track, the first
such in the Republic of Ireland. In the early 1990s it was renamed
after Billy Morton, the late administrator who had initiated the
original track and who brought famous athletes to compete in the
stadium. It hosted the athletics events of the Special Olympics
World Games in 2003.</p>
<p><br />
The stadium consists of a small covered stand with 800 seats and
three sides of open terracing, bringing the total capacity up to
4,000. The stand encompasses dressing rooms and other facilities;
there are also separate clubhouses for the associated clubs. The
stadium complex also has indoor athletics training facilities.</p>

<p style="text-align:right">On 25 July 2008, a special event was
held in the stadium called the Morton Memorial Meeting to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the aforementioned world mile
record in an event promoted by the late Billy Morton.</p>
