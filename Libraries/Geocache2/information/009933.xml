<p><b>Donabate railway station is located on the main
Dublin-Belfast Railway line.</b></p></center>
<p>The station opened in 1844 and boasts an array of Dublin &
Drogheda and Great Northern Railway station buildings. The main
building, a two storey red bricked type was built prior to GNR take
over in the 1870s and is therefore unlike others on the line.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>Side-Tracked Caches are intended to provide quick
Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations.</p>
<p>The Cache is a small micro container please rehide it well to
prevent the many muggles from discovering it.</p>
