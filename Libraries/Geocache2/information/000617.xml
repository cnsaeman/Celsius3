  <description>In a historic Right of Way known locally as Walker's Woods</description>
  <long-description>Walkers Wood is a little known right of way connecting the village of Barnaculla on the slopes of the Three Rock Mountain to the top of Killgobbin Lane (Now Closed at the top to form a Cul de Sac at the Enniskerry Road. 

The Entrance to the woods is at the intersection of the Enniskerry Road and the Burrow Road at the coordinates listed below.

There is no signage. Go through the gates and you will find the path which will take you through native deciduous woodland to the village of Barnaculla and the famous Blue Light pub. 

Note a huge Monkey Puzzle Tree inside the gate among the ruins of what was once a gate lodge.

There is a short tunnel where the Right of way passes under an avenue within the estate which owns the land on either side of the path. The terrain under this overpass is very muddy in wet weather. 

The Cache is in the only location where the sides of the path separate giving some space for away from the main path for hiding. 

There is a delicate balance between the right of way here, as there is in many cases in Ireland. The land owner through which this path travels has respected this right of way over many years. Such attention should be reciprocated. This cache is placed so that the seeker need not cross any fence wall gate or other barrier. It can be sought and found entirely within the bounds of the Right of Way. The cache itself rests against an old remnant of a stone wall. The cache is not located in the wall but is beside the wall hidden by stones which are not part of the wall. There is no need to rummage among the rocks of the wall or to climb up on the wall. Standing looking at the wall one can discover the cache among rocks which lean against the wall. 

The finder should be careful in removing and replacing the hiding rocks. Hide it well and do not allow the weight of the rocks to crack the plastic of the container.

[Note on Cache Maintenance: This cache will be maintained by a local resident and the details are on file with Geocaching.com]
