  <long-description><p>In the midst of frenetic development, a little oasis of calm! On
the outskirts of Stepaside, now an expanding suburb of SW
Dublin.</p>
<p>Kilgobbin Graveyard</p>
<p>The ruined church which now stands at Kilgobbin was built as
recently as 1707, by Archbishop King to serve the parishes of
Kilgobbin, Taney and Cruagh and went out of use in 1826 when the
new church at Kiltiernan was built. It occupied the site of a
church which was already ancient at the time of the Norman
invasion. This was founded by Saint Gobban whose feast day on 1st
April is recorded in the Martyrology of Tallaght. Apart from the
name of the patron no information about this monastery is
available. A stone cross, bullaun and some grave slabs survive from
this period, and can still be seen.</p>
<p>The site is located on the summit of a gravel hill, which is
emphasised by the fact that gravel quarrying has been carried out
on the slopes of the hill giving it a very steep and high
appearance. The existing church was restored by the County Council
in 1983 when the old rendering was removed, the walls pointed and
the porch, which was in dangerous condition,was rebuilt. Within the
church are preserved all the decorated and worked stones which were
found during the restoration work</p>
<p>2 long stones with notches in the end</p>
<p>1 complete early grave slab</p>
<p>1 piece early slab with concentric circles</p>
<p>3 pieces granite window frame</p>
<p>3 pieces quern stones</p>
<p>1 piece crosshead now missing</p>
<p>The Cross</p>
<p>According to a tradition recorded in the last century this cross
was found buried in the graveyard when the enclosing wall was being
built about 1800. It was then erected in its present location. It
is not recorded if the base was already in position. The base is
certainly ancient as there is a bullaun 1 ft in diameter cut in it.
The cross is very much weathered but on it can be seen a figure in
a long garment with extended arms, standing on a small platform. A
somewhat similar figure is on the opposite face. This probably
represents a crucifixion on one face and Christ in Glory on the
other, as appears on many ninth and tenth century crosses.</p>
<p>There is a shallow moulding at the angles of the shaft and
another down the centre which terminates at the bottom with a pair
of leaves. A similar feature can be seen on the cross at Kilfenora,
Co.Clare. There is a tenon on the top of the cross which would have
held a capping stone in position. According to the O.S. Letters
there was formerly a holy well, known as the Eye Well, near the
church but a drain sunk in its neighbourhood caused it to
disappear.</p></long-description>

The 'clamp down' mechanism of the box seems to be missing. I tidied it up and rehid as best I could. I nearly chopped my finger off closing the lid as can happen with these containers. Great for hiding things in but also an efficient finger guillotine! Anyway no major damage done.
