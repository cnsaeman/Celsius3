  <long-description>Sidetracked Ashtown

Small cache at one of Dublins local train stations on the Western line. It is designed to be easily located. There is no need to enter the station proper or walk along any platforms.

This lovely small community has developed during the recent Celtic Tiger into a pleasant modern apartment centred living space along the Royal Canal.

Ashtown is a commuter railway station serving Ashtown, Dublin 15 (Ireland). It lies on the Dublin to Longford commuter railway route.[1]. The station was opened by the Midland Great Western Railway in 1847 for race specials at the now demolished Phoenix Park Race Course. It opened fully on 1 August 1902.[1]. Absorbed into the Great Southern Railways by way of the Railways (Great Southern) Preliminary Amalgamation Scheme of 12 November 1924 (SI no. 31 of that year), the station closed in 1934.

The line through the station was then nationalised, passing on to the Coras Iompair Éireann as a result of the Transport Act 1944 which took effect from 1 January 1945. Under this management it re-opened briefly in 1979 for the visit of Pope John Paul II to Ireland in order to facilitate the large numbers who attended the open air mass in the Phoenix Park, and re-opened permanently on 11 January 1982

It passed on to the Iarnród Éireann in 1986.

The footbridge came from Midleton on the Youghal line.</long-description>
