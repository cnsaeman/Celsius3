<p><b>The Criminal Courts of Justice (CCJ)</b> complex, on Parkgate
Street near the entrance to Dublin's Phoenix Park, has already been
dubbed 'The Pantheon' because its great hall is four times the size
of the Four Courts' central Round Hall.</p>
<p>The complex became fully operational in January 2010, hearing
all criminal cases in Dublin, ranging from District Court remand
hearings to the Court of Criminal Appeal and including the Circuit
Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court. It is expected to
hear up to 200,000 cases a year.</p>
<p>The Criminal Courts complex is the largest State building to be
constructed since the James Gandon-designed Four Courts in
1796.</p>
<p>The complex was built through a public-private partnership and
will be managed on a 25-year contract, after which it will be
handed over to the Courts Service. It cost &euro;140 million to
design and build, and came in three months ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>It will be the first courthouse in the world where
suspects,victims, judges, lawyers, jurors and members of the public
will not meet until they enter a courtroom. The circulation system
will enhance the privacy, and protection of different court users,
including witnesses.</p>
<p>The 23,000 sq m, 9-storey building has 450 rooms and can
accommodate up to 100 prisoners - in a series of underground
holding cells. The CCJ has 22 hi-tech court rooms and a dedicated
victim-support facility, with suites for vulnerable
witnesses,victims of crime and their relatives. It also boasts a
playroom with video-link facilities for child witnesses - designed
in consultation with children's charity Barnardos. The complex
contains accommodation for 150 barristers and offices for the
Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Probation Service, Law
Society and Management Company as well as judges&rsquo;chambers and
press rooms.</p>
<p>The existing Four Courts buildings will remain in use for civil
cases.</p>

<p>The Cache is located away from the entrance to the building,as
due to the nature of the building I didn't think it was a good idea
for cachers to be found acting in a manner that could be construed
as suspicious.</p>
<p>You do not need to enter the courts to find the cache;
however,it is well worth a visit. It's an impressive building, with
several floors and the main hall open to the public.</p>
<p><b>Hopefully you'll only ever enter through the front
entrance!</b></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
