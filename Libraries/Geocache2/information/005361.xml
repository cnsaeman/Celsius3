This cache is one of six in the "Dublin's Railway Termini" series.
The full series, consisting of Westland Row, Amiens Street,
Kingsbridge, North Wall, Broadstone and Harcourt Street will bring
you to the railway termini, both past and present, of Dublin city
and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the vast railway
network that once served the city. Today the railway buildings
remain as impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities. While some of the buildings remain in use
as railway stations, others are sadly neglected relics of Dublin's
railway past. <br />
<br />
Inside the lid of each cache you will find 2 numbers printed in red
and white lettering. Gather all 12 numbers and you will be able to
ascertain the coordinates for an exclusive 7th cache relating to
Dublin's railway history. <br />
<br />
In 1861 the London and North Western Railway Company, which had
been operating a steam packet service across the Irish Sea, moved
its Irish terminus from Dun Laoghaire to North Wall Quay. The
station was designed to serve the ferry port whose steamships
moored here for the Irish Sea crossing. Despite the station's
conversion for freight usage after the First World War, there are
many indications of its previous function, lending the building a
certain character that it otherwise might lack. The station is
generally unknown to most Dubliners. It is even less visible from
the opposite bank of the river than its neighbour, The Former
British Rail Hotel. The effect of the facade is increased by the
knowledge that a deserted railway station lies behind it, albeit in
an almost ruinous state. The large empty spaces underneath the
steel girders, braces and trusses, which still appear to be in good
condition, remain impressive. Apart from the role the station has
played in the history of Irish transport, there is a more poignant
association with the First World War: For many of those who joined
the British Army during that period, it was the last Dublin
building they passed through on their way to the trenches. Today
the building is used as freight offices for Iarnod Eireann, but is
a sadly neglected relic. <br />
<br />
Adjacent to the station lies an equally impressive architectural
masterpiece, the former British Rail Hotel. In 1883 the North
Western Railway Company bought the Prince of Wales Hotel, and soon
afterwards replaced it with this building, the London and North
Western Hotel. It was later known as the British Rail Hotel. The
hotel was occupied by British officers during the War of
Independence and, according to local folklore, was a frequent
target of the IRA. It became known as the British Rail Hotel after
the nationalisation of the railways but had ceased to be a hotel in
the 1920s. It now houses offices of Iarnród Éireann. Its historical
associations provide a link to an era when travel between Ireland
and Britain was a more difficult and time-consuming undertaking
than it is today. With the demise of the ferry services from North
Wall, the building was taken over by CIE, and it now contains
offices of Irish Rail including the architects department. <br />
<br />
The cache is a magnetic micro. Please replace it as you found it,
ensuring it is not visible. Beware of possible watching eyes in
this area. <br />
<br />
Note: the cache site has some small thorns surrounding it, so you
may need gloves to retrieve it without getting scrathed! <br />
