<p>The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) is the rail line running
along the coast of Dublin, from Malahide and Howth southwards as
far as Greystones, Co Wicklow.</p>
<p>Side-Tracked Caches are intended to provide quick
cache-and-dashes at train stations.<br />
The Cache is a small micro container - please re-hide it well to
ensure that the commuting muggles don’t discover it.</p></long-description>

This was our last cache find in Ireland. We have spent the last 8 days travelling around this beautiful country, seeing wonderful things and meeting great people. We will take away lots of happy memories. A quick find in the evening with Smurfyguy and Geotooter. Many thanks for the cache. I enjoyed travelling on the DART. G'day from Down-Under.</li><li>2010-04-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by Smurfyguy <br />#206
Greetings from Sydney, Australia. Found with Calypso62 and Geotooter.
Nice quick find while returning from our day trip to Dublin.
