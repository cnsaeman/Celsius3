You will find the starting point for this simple multi-cache in old
Kilbarrack graveyard located along the coast road.</description>
  <long-description><p>The following description of the location comes from the
Kilbarrack Parish Website: &lsquo;The ruins of a 13th century
church stand on the site today on the seafront between Clontarf and
Howth. It was later a mariners' Church, where sailors came to give
thanks for a safe voyage and to bury their dead. It may also have
been a haven for shipwrecked sailors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The churchyard adjoining is chiefly notable as the burying-place
of Francis Higgins, called from an early incident in his career the
Sham Squire. He was a somewhat unscrupulous adventurer who managed
to obtain a questionable political prominence in Dublin in the last
troubled years of the eighteenth century. Another resident of the
graveyard is Gaelic League and Irish Volunteers founder Eoin
MacNeill.</p>
<p>The location is mentioned by Brendan Behan in Borstal Boy
&lsquo;So many belonging to me lay buried in Kilbarrack, the
healthiest graveyard in Ireland, they said, because it is so close
to the sea...&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Topographical Dictionary of Ireland from 1837 describes it
as &lsquo;unfenced and overgrown with weeds&rsquo; a description
that is still somewhat accurate today. The church is noted in some
records as the Chapel of Mone.</p>
<p>The cache is a small size lock and lock container located away
from the graveyard at stage 2. Be aware that getting to stage 2
involves crossing a very busy road so use the pedestrian crossings
if accompanied by small children. It is in a highly muggled area so
please take great care retrieving and replacing the cache.</p>
<p>Bus routes along the coast road are the 31, 31b, 32a and 32/b.
The cache is about a 15 minute walk from Bayside dart station.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> N 53 23.243 W 006 08.001 Look for
Rosetta&rsquo;s gravestone. Call her date of birth ABCD and her
date of death EFGH.</p>
Use the letters you worked out above in following equation to
calculate the final co-ordinates:
<p>N 53 ((B*C)+D).(A+E)((B+D+H)*(A+G)) W 06 0D.F0E</p>
<p><strong>Final Stage:</strong> At stage 2 look for a sign written
at your feet. The number of letters in the second word will give
you the number of steps down you need to go to find the cache.</p></long-description>
