  <long-description><p>St. Audoen's Park, although less than 0.5 hectares in size, is
quite significant in historical terms. Located adjacent to St.
Audoen's Church (1300 A.D.), it incorporates the first stone city
wall dating from about 1100 A.D.; St. Audoen's Arch, the last
surviving entrance to the old city; and Fagan's Gate.</p>
<p>The City Wall was restored in 1976 as part of Architectural
Heritage Year and the park development of 1982 won a prestigious
civic award. Audoen was a 7th - century Bishop of Rouen (France)
and the nearby church named after him is reputedly one of the
oldest still used for regular religious services.</p>
<p>The park is closed at night, but the hours are not posted – it
is definitely open between 9.00 am and 5.00 pm.</p>
<p>First location - The above coordinates will place you near a
gate and a plaque celebrating a Civic award – take a note of the
date on the plaque.</p>
<p>Second location - add the second digit from the date to the N
coordinate ( N 53 20.631 + ? = N 53 20.6??; W 006 16.459)). How
many steps do you climb to this point?</p>
<p>For the third location, multiply the number of steps by 3 and
subtract this number from the N coordinate for the second location
and reverse the last two digits of the date on the plaque and add
them to the W coordinate for the second location</p>
<p>The cache is approximately 2 metres away - there's no need to go
into the flower beds or the bushes (there may be syringes dumped
there)</p></long-description>
