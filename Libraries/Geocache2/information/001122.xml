  <long-description>One of a series of caches along the Dodder River – the paths linking these caches are wheelchair and buggy/pram passable, unless otherwise stated.  All the caches in this series are also accessible to the wheelchair user, unless otherwise stated.
 This cache can be accessed from either direction, parking at N53 18.367  W006 16.020  or N 53 18.441  W006 15.595 - it is accessible by, and from, wheelchair.  You can also aim for “Dodder – Dropping Well” and "Dodder – St Anne’s”, if you wish.</long-description>
