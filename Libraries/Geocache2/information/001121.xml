<br />
 Collins Barracks is a former military barracks in the Arbour Hill
area of Dublin, Ireland. The buildings are now the National Museum
of Ireland, Decorative Arts and History. Housing both British armed
forces, and Irish army garrisons through three centuries, the
barracks were the oldest continuously occupied example in the
world. <br />
<br />
Originally called simply The Barracks, and later The Royal
Barracks, the name was changed to Collins Barracks when handed over
to the Irish Free State in 1922. <br />
<br />
Built in 1702, and further extended in the late eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, the complex's main buildings are
neo-classical in style. Since 1997 the barracks have been home to
collections of the National Museum of Ireland (for Decorative Arts
and History exhibits), and the original structures have seen some
award winning redevelopment and conservation work to support this
new role. <br />
<br />
The museum faces the Luas tram "red line" (Museum stop), a Memorial
Garden at Croppies Acre marking the 1798 rebellion, and the River
Liffey. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Please note the museum opening hours - I don't think you will be
able to find the cache outside of these hours - <br />
<br />
Monday: Closed<br />
Tuesday - Saturday: 10am - 5pm<br />
Sunday: 2pm - 5pm<br />
Closed Mondays, Christmas Day and Good Friday.<br />
<br />
 Admission to the museum is free, and it is well worth a
visit.<br />
<br />
The cache is a magnetic micro. Please replace it exactly as you
found it, making sure it is not visible. Enjoy!<br />
