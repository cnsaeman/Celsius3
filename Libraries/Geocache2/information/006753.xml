  <long-description><p>Bull Island or more properly North Bull Island is an island
located in Dublin Bay in Ireland, about 5 km (3.1 mi) long and 800
m wide, lying roughly parallel to the shore. It is less than two
centuries old, having been formed by sand building up after the
North Bull Wall (designed by Capt. William Bligh, of Bounty fame)
was completed in the early 19th century to keep clear the channel
to Dublin Port.</p>
<p>Take a walk and enjoy the views. Before you find the cache you

<p>Also at this location count the uplighters and call this
<b>H</b></p>

The first time the final location was fenced off for some construction work.
The second time we didn't have the patience to search for long as it was difficult to avoid all the dog droppings.
Today we decided to go and get it. And we did.

Don't know how we could have overlooked it the previous time but it's definitely there. A bit prickly, though. Very busy on Bull Island today. The Dollymount Sea Scouts were out with their kayaks, fighting against the wind. There must also have been a swimming event. Met lots of dripping wet men after they braved the sea. Good we didn't come by car and just walked over.

Finding the cache was quite easy.
