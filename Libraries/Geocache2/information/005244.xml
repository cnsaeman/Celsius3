  <long-description><p>Educate Together is the representative organisation of the
Educate Together schools and associations throughout the Republic
of Ireland. It owes its origins to the movement to establish new
multi-denominational primary schools, which emerged in the late
1970s and early 1980s. By 1984, when Educate Together was
established, there were three schools and the organisation acted as
their co-ordinating body. Since then the movement has grown
considerably.<br />
 Today there are 56 schools, 26 of which are in the greater Dublin
area. The organisation became a company limited by guarantee in
1998 and has charitable status. It has a small national office
which provides representative and support services to existing
schools and Start Up groups. The Directors and members of the
company work in a voluntary capacity.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-13T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Blue Jay 59 <br />Like the last chacher - we had no luck - solved the puzzle and found hollow tree - bang on the co-ords but no cache.
Will email details to CO in case it's muggled.
TFTC anyhow.
</li><li>2010-05-30T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by thomasvm <br />Solved the clue - and searched at least four holow trees - but could not find it. A lot of muggles around, so it will have to wait until the next visit.</li><li>2010-05-11T19:00:00Z : Found it by medic143 <br />one of 3 done after a small job in Balbriggan. DId the maths correctly. My GPS lead me to a likely prospect (BTW I cache in shorts and this is NOT shorts friendly), turned out to be the wrong spot but the GPS then suggested a second spot. Cache is well hidden

TNLN TFTC</li><li>2010-04-24T19:00:00Z : Found it by Donnacha <br />Found after attending the CITO. Thanks.</li><li>2010-03-21T19:00:00Z : Found it by merann <br />Lovely spot with muggles galore in Ardgillan today as it was a beautiful day. The cache was an easy enough find after we had gathered up all the info required. TNLNSL.
