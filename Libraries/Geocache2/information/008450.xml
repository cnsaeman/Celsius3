  <description>A very easy walk for all ages in an urban park in Walkinstown</description>
  <long-description>Cache number 3 of Justy Dawson. This is a small container hidden in a park that when I visited was completly deserted. 

Its the last place you would suspect a park to be located. Easy to access and plenty of parking beside Lidl opposite.

The park has a revolving gate, so open at all hours. 

The cache is a small amo box, contains a rolled up log book and geocoins/travel bugs

Please place back and hide where this is hidden. Watch for muggles.</long-description>

I went down to walkinstown park and it looks like this urban cache has been muggled by someone.

If there is a demand for this cache I will replace it is an awkward location to set up a cache without it being seen or muggled
</li><li>2010-02-03T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Serapis <br />This was on my handheld for a while so I didn't have all the DNF records and obviously I wouldn't have went looking for it. As it turns out I didn't find it but I didn't spent too long looking for it as I was in my work attire and had to attend a meeting afterwards. The park was deserted at lunchtime. Hopr it is back up soon.
