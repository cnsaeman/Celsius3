  <description>The cache is located at the Hole in the wall beach (Burrow beach).
We recommend you gain entry to the beach via Claremont road.
Parking is available on this road. Alternatively, you could take
the Dart to Sutton train station or get the 31, 31B or 31C bus
which serve Sutton and walk to the cache from there. Please enjoy a
walk along the beach, but:

  <long-description>Burrow beach is a wonderful sandy beach with scenic views. It is a
continuation of Claremont beach. It's known as The Hole In The Wall
as that's how people gained access to the beach from Claremont
Road. The old wall is gone, but the little lane reamains between
the houses.

#334</li><li>2010-05-09T19:00:00Z : Write note by Fitzet <br />This is the biggest and busiest cache around so made a quick trip this evening to drop off a number of travel bugs.  They shouldn't have to wait long to move on.

In : Good luck to you fellow cacher TB, Photo Travel Bug TB, TC's Roots Crawler TB, U2 Around the World TB (Cache is close to Larry's house...)
Out: Nothing</li><li>2008-11-09T20:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Our first for the day and Gavin and Anton's first ever. We walked up from Sutton and initially went right past the easy access - until we saw someone confirming that although closed to cars it was possible for us to go that very handy way.

Great cache, I'd be inclined to call it a large instead of a regular myself. Took a coin and left a coin.</li></ul></logs>
