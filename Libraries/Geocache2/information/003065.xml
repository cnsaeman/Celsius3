<center><b><i>Great granite portal<br />
Glistening with the light<br />
Of a million mirrors in which I<br />
Can see the rituals of druids<br />
And falcons from ancient forests.<br />
And a young celt whispering<br />
Through the heather to meet<br />
A dearly loved one like you.<br />
<br />
You the bedrock of my soul!<br />

The Coffin Stone is a megallithic portal tomb under which some
human remains were apparently found some years ago. It is quite an
imposing lump of rock and I would hate to think of the poor souls
that may have had to lift it at some point! I find it difficult to
imagine too many people living out here in the wilderness back in
those times but I presume people did hunt deer and other game
around here. Also, I think it may have looked a lot different, with
plenty of natural forests of various indigenous and perhaps
deciduous kinds.<br />
If you manage to trek up here around April May time then listen out
for the arrival of a cuckoo or two. Also, plenty of ravens twirling
and "flipping." If you are lucky you may spot a peregrine or a red
kite. There are also kestrels about and all sorts of buntings,
larks and willow tits. The forests throughout the trek are full of
finches, strikingly beautiful chaffinches in particular.<br />
The cache is placed close to the Coffin Stone itself which lies
near the saddle between Djouce Mountain (approx 800 metres down
from Djouce trig point) and War Hill.<br />
The OSI map also shows an ancient Standing Stone nearby but I must
say that I was unable to find it.<br />
The illustration above shows a trekking route from Crone car park
which can take in quite a few good caches. You would indeed be
treated to some spectacular views throughout this trek, weather
permitting!<br />

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-12T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />After a short break on War Hill, it was an easy walk across to the Coffin Stone. I had been there often enough for picnic stops while out in the hills (perfect peaceful place to sit on a sunny day, when Djouce summit can get crowded), but never gone on to War Hill.

This stone is huge and is surrounded by smaller similar stones - granite unlike the schist cone that forms the summit of Djouce. My impression is that it was never moved very far - if at all - and was used opportunistically as the capstone of a portal tomb that was effectively built around it in situ. The name "coffin stone" probably refers to the shape.

There is no standing stone, and in fact the fictional standing stone doesn't appear on my (4th edition) discovery sheet 56. It seems to have resulted from a mistake where the coffin stone was shown as "standing stone" and then later both were shown.

The cache has rolled in quite deep, so you need to stick your arm right in!</li><li>2010-05-27T19:00:00Z : Found it by didi2206 <br />What a great cache... I've been up so often but never bothered to head over this direction.. thanks for bringing me bringing here!!! So sunny and dry lately- gorgeous walk!</li><li>2010-05-18T19:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />My second of the " walk in the garden series ". Clouds were gathering in & view was not so good today. Ah well - we had the hike & found the cache - now on to Djouce.
