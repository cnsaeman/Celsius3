<p align="justify">1st Irish phone box was opened in 1925 and is
still standing (and working!) on Dawson Street, Dublin. This type
is named K1 Mk234 and it's made of concrete panels with a wooden
door and window frames. Not many of that type of phone kiosks
survived, second one in Dublin still stands at the gate of
Leopardstown Golf Club, Foxrock.<br />
<br />
Not many old types of phone boxes in Ireland survived. They are
very often wrecked, and since mobile phones are very popular
payphones, the old ones are not used too often. Eircom who owns an
maintains these phone boxes decided to dismount a good number of
them. But still people make thousands calls per week using
payphones, and the wireless broadband, which is available in some
of them, keeps the phone boxes alive.<br />
<br />
One of Dublin phone boxes was very famous for another reason. In
the end of 1970s one phone box at Rossmore Road in Templeogue was
faulty and international calls were free of charge. Every day there
was a long queue of people waiting in patience for their turn to
talk with family and friends who were on emigration<br />
<br />
 <b>Stage #1:</b><br />
Start coordinates are close to the old phone box on Dawson Street.
There is a small manhole with a steel cover on the pavement, just
at the back of phone box. There is a 6 digit number on it. Call it
<b><font color="green">ABCDEF</font></b>. Use these digits to
figure out another number:<br />
<br />
<b>01676<font color="green">FEA(D-C)</font></b><br />
<br />
And this is... a phone number of another public phone. You have to
locate this one, and this is the most difficult part of the cache.
It's up to you how you will find it. Helpful information - every
payphone in Dublin has a bell, so you can answer incoming
calls.<br />
<br />
 <b>Stage #2:</b><br />
When you will finally locate the correct phone box, all is simple
now. On the other side of road, just opposite the phone there is a
shop with a 3 digit number. Call it
<b><font color="red">WXY</font></b>. Close to this shop (on the
other side of the road from the phone box) there is a lamppost with
a number - call this number <b><font color="red">Z</font></b>
.<br />
<br />
The final cache is at coordinates:<br />
<b>N 53° 20.<font color="red">WXW</font><br />
W 006° 1<font color="red">Y.Z(X-W)W</font></b><br />
<br />
<b>The cache:</b><br />
The cache is a micro container and includes a logbook, a pencil and
a little FTF prize.<br />
Distance from stage #1 to stage #2 is about 10 minutes walk, and
from stage #2 to the final location will take another 10
minutes.</p>

Not many muggles around late on a Friday evening.
Used the clue.

Dooh!!</li><li>2010-04-04T19:00:00Z : Found it by Knight&Fox <br />Haha what a great cache! On the first attempt the bloke on the other end couldn't quite understand what we were asking of him and subsequently hung up. Unperturbed, we tried again a little later in the day from a different payphone only to have it eat our euro. Third time lucky and we had a very interested chap who had a few things to say about the particular store that the phone was located out the front of. All-in-all a very entertaining cache!
