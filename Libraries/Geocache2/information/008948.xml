  <long-description><p>A quick cache and dash at Ireland's first motorway service
station which opened this week.<br />
Motorway Mayhem caches are designed to provide fairly easy drive-by
caches for travellers who are in need of a break.<br />
You can access this cache from Junction 5 at both the North and
South bound exits.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The cache is a magnetic micro container please rehide it with
care to prevent muggles from discovering its location</p>
