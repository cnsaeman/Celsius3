  <long-description>This cache is located in the Iveagh Gardens, a hidden gem in the centre of Dublin city. The park is unknown to many of the city's residents, and as such remains a quiet relaxing escape from the chaos of a busy city day. The park can be reached from either Clonmel Street (Off Harcourt Street) or from behind the U.C.D. buildings at Earlsfort Terrace. 

The park's opening hours are - 

Summer: Monday-Saturday: 8am-6pm
Sundays & Bank Holidays: 10am-6pm.

Winter: As above but closes according to daylight hours.

The park, originally a garden known as Leeson's Fields, is maintained by Duchas, The Heritage Service of Ireland. In the 1860s the gardens were leased to the Dublin Exhibition Palace and Winter Garden Company, which built an impressive exhibition building and Winter Gardens for the Dublin International Exhibition of 1865. Despite initial success, the Dublin Exhibition ran out of steam and the buildings fell into direpair. The central stone building survives today as the University and The National Concert Hall complex, but the Winter Palace was demolished. 

Upon entering from the Earlsfort Terrace entrance, a large sunken lawn is located on your right. This is Ireland's only purpose built archery field, and contains the remains of an elephant from Dublin Zoo, which was buried there in the 1920s! Follow the path along the outer edge of the lawn and, turning left at the end of the path, you pass the Caretakers house and the Cascade, an immense rockery, comes into view. The rocks in the cascade are obtained from every county in Ireland. Continuing to the far wall, through the box hedge garden, and you will reach a minature copy of London's Hampton Court Maze. Nearby, and flanked by two high rockeries is the Rosarium. From there, if you wander along the east path, you will see an area deliberately left wild. Once upon a time the glass enclosed Winter Gardens stood here, and some evidence of their existence still remains, in the form of the large cut stones, plinths, and statues lining the path. 

It may be difficult to get satelite reception in the park -the best place is probably the main avenue between the two fountains.

nethersturm (omw with toechterchen)</li><li>2005-10-01T07:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Great hide, gorgeous park. Being not very well known it had a couple of dubious charaters floating around so I had to wait for them to get bored and wander off. I did expect to see more people on a Saturday to tell the truth. If I'd had some company I would have stopped to explore the park some more, but since the floaters were making me feel uncomfortable I moved away as soon as I was finished with the cache.

Cache needs some serious attention - has become waterlogged. The log book was wet and mouldy and I could not leave a log in it. No sign of any of the TBs. TNLNSN. </li></ul></logs>
