  <long-description>Can be reached easily from centre city by bus or on foot or cycle.
Car parking provided but costs. Free car parking at pub near
entrance.<br>
<br>
The Multi-Cache:<br>
<br>
Don’t be worried about the tree cover which is extensive throughout
the gardens. The areas you need to be are all pretty clear so
coordinates should not be a great difficulty.<br>
<br>
1. Above coordinates take you to a grounded star for info (as I
write this in September 06 there is a temporary sculpture series on
display at the gardens and the "grounded star" is covered with
small stones and an arty representation of "20 Standing Forms".
According to it (the star), approx 50 paces north (a couple of
hedges are in the way but you get the idea!) to a large Magnolia
Acuminata (within an enclosure) with the designation xx 00?36?.
Subtract 2 from third figure and use the 6th figure to give you
??<br>
2. At N53 22.336 W006 16.284 You should be standing at a glass door
(usually closed). With your back up against the door walk 24 paces
SE to a Simaroubacae with the designation xx 013?19. Use missing
number.Theme should be clear by now!<br>
3. At N53 22.428 W006 16.289 find Socrates and standing with your
back right up against him walk 42 paces SE to a Pinus Nigra with
the designation xx ??????. Subtract 12836 from this to give ???

“…Our Botanic Establishment is the brightest jewel I am proud to
say in the Dublin Society’s cap, admired by all who have visited
it”<br>
 Dr Walter Wade 3rd May 1819<br>
<br>
The National Botanic Gardens are definitely worth a visit for
anybody coming to Dublin for the first time. There is a
breathtaking variety and quality of plant life both native and
otherwise. The gardens were originally laid out from 1795 and they
have undergone a series of modifications and improvements up to the
present day.<br>
Originally designed for scientific study only, the gardens have
developed a worldwide reputation in the development of
horticulture. Today they are under the care of The Heritage Service
of The Office of Public Works which is implementing The Global
Strategy of plant conservation in all its activities.<br>
The present plant population includes approximately 20,000 species
and cultivated varieties. There is something to please the
botanist, gardener and casual visitor alike. The Rose Garden should
always be included in any visit. The Thomas Moore Rose, raised as a
cutting from the original plant and immortalized in the ballad “The
Last Rose of Summer”, is just west of the Cactus House. The
Rhododendron and heather collections and the rockery are always of
interest. For indoor folk one of the glass houses contains the
giant Amazon water lily. These glass houses themselves, some
restored as recently as the late nineties, are worthy of
consideration for their fine workmanship.<br>
 Finally. some of the finest individual specimens in the Botanic
Gardens are trees, e.g. Weeping Cedar, Dwarf Cedar, Purple Beech,
Dawn Redwood and Caucasian Elm.<br>
You could spend the day here and not see half of what is on
offer.<br></long-description>

We've been here many times before, but never in such good weather, and never with so many crowds.

Locating the first stage was a guess - the 'grounded star' could not be identified, but we were able to get from there to Stage II without a problem. From Stage II, it was plain sailing (apart from our inability to walk in a SE direction) to the cache location, with the help of the hint.

The glass houses that were ruins years ago, fully renovated and looking absolutely beautiful.
We really enjoyed our stroll around and look forward to returning in the summer to see more growth & colour. It was lovely today, so I'm sure it will be even more beautiful then. Might even take the tour [:D] Thanks for bringing me back here.
Had a problem with the first location, searched all around but could find nothing resembling the description [:O], Is it still there? 
Anyway spotted the magnolias in the enclosure, so carried on from there.

</li><li>2009-03-17T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Such a beautiful St Paddys' Day so we headed to the gardens. We've been in Dublin for 3 and a half years and this is our first trip. Wish we'd come sooner, the gardens are beautiful. Cache itself was easy to find, if a little tricky to retrieve with the parking attendant muggles watching so closely. TFTC</li></ul></logs>
