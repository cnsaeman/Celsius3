<p>In the early days of aviation in the year 1913 Lord
Northcliff's<br />
'Daily Mail' offered a prize of £5,000 to the first airman<br />
who would fly all around the British Isles. The total
distance<br />
was of 1600 miles to be completed in 72 hours.</p></description>
  <long-description><p>The only competitor to take part was the famous Australian<br />
aviator, Harry G. Hawker (and his mechanic named Kauper) in a<br />
100 h.p. Sopwith HT (Hydro-Tractor) Seaplane. Everything went<br />
well up the East Coast of England and across Scotland and the<br />
Irish Sea but while flying down the east coast of Ireland
towards<br />
Dun Laoghaire, the plane went out of control and crashed into<br />
the middle of Loughshinny Bay on Wednesday 27th of August.</p>
<p>The two airmen were rescued by local fishermen but when
they<br />
returned the next day to rescue their plane they discovered
that<br />
it had been completely stripped at low tide by souvenir
hunters.<br />

<p>H.G, HAWKER, AIRMAN: HIS LIFE AND WORK</p>
<p>By<br />
MURIEL HAWKER<br />
1922</p>
<p>Chapter VI (Extract)</p>
<p>Rising at 4 a.m. on Wednesday, the partners enjoyed a hurried
breakfast, and then had a good look over their machine. At 5.30
they were all prepared, and at 5.42 they started for Dublin, having
previously arranged to call on the way at Larne for petrol. But the
machine was reluctant to leave the water, and Harry beached her
about a mile from Oban. After spending an hour in extracting water
from the floats, he made a good re-start. Before leaving Scotland
he landed at Kiells, in Argyllshire, in order to effect a minor
engine adjustment. At 8.25 he was in the air again ; and 65 minutes
later he glided down into Larne Harbour. He made south for Dublin
at ten o'clock, only to be foiled a few miles short of the Irish
capital by what he described as "just a piece of ghastly bad
luck."</p>
<p>Suspecting that some of the valve-springs had failed, Harry
decided to come down to inspect them. Meanwhile the engine had been
running and developing its power, but an ominous rattle had worried
Harry and Kauper. It was unfortunate that they did not know that
Mr. Green, the designer of the engine, was awaiting them at Dublin
with a set of new valve -springs. Had they been so acquainted,
Harry would, of course, have continued on to Dublin without coming
down to have a look at the springs. As it was, while descending in
a spiral he lost control owing to his greasy boot slipping on the
rudder-bar, and the aeroplane side- slipped into the water. Harry
was unhurt, but poor Kauper suffered a broken arm and some cuts
about the head. He was soon taken to the Mater Misericordia
Hospital, at Dublin, where he made a good recovery, ultimately
leaving the hospital on September i8th, 1913, with all his wounds
healing well. The machine, of course, was done for.</p>
<p>Thus ended the most important event held under the auspices of
the Royal Aero Club during 1913, in which 1,043 miles were covered
in 55! hours, the actual flying time being 21 hours 44 minutes a
world's record for a seaplane in those days. In recognition of his
skill and courage, the Daily Mail made Harry a personal present of
1,000.</p>
<p>On the morning after the crash near Dublin Harry was busy
superintending the work of dismantling the wrecked aeroplane. While
so employed he was considerably interrupted by photographers and
autograph hunters. Apparently souvenir hunters were also on the
scene during his absence, for one of the radiators had been
carefully detached. Having seen to the packing-up of the remains of
the machine, Harry returned to Brooklands, where on Friday, with
his usual nonchalance, he was testing machines for the
Admiralty.<br /></p>
