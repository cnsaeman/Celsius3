  <description>Dublin&rsquo;s Phoenix Park is a treasure with more than 1700 acres
of walled parkland just 3km from the centre of the city.
<p>At 707 hectares (1752 acres) is one of the largest enclosed
recreational spaces within any European capital city.<br /></p></description>

<p>Few cities have such a facility on their doorsteps &ndash; it is
more than twice as large as Central Park in New York.</p>
<p>The park was for centuries the property of the King&rsquo;s
representatives in Ireland, used as a Royal hunting park &ndash;
which is why it was enclosed by a wall, to keep the game in.</p>
<p>However it was opened to the public in 1747 and so for more than
250 years has been a favourite playground for generations of
Dubliners.</p>
<p>The park is open all year round, there is no admission charge
and visitors can explore freely.</p>
<p>The nearest gate to the cache location is pedestrian only access
point beside Farmleigh which is an estate of 78 acres situated to
the north-west of the park.</p>
<p>However the cache location is accessible from any entrance point
to the park.</p>

<p>The cache is located on a trek adjacent to the gate
keeper&rsquo;s lodge.</p>
<p>Parking is freely available on Whites Road leading up to the
gate. N53.21.992 W06.21.180 and on Chesterfield Avenue at
N53.22.166 W06.20.885 where the final location is a pleasent walk
away off road on a flat treelined track</p></long-description>
