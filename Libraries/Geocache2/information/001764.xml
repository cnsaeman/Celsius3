  <long-description><p>The cache is located in Father Collins Park. The park was
selected as one of the seven landmark projects in sustainability
for Dublin City Council. The park was named after a much respected
local parish priest who was instrumental in its original
acquisition for development as a public park. An international
design competition for the park was held in 2003. The Fr. Collins
Park project began in September 2007 and was designed by the
Argentinean architects Abelleyro & Romero.</p>
<p>The park was officially opened on 27th May 2009 and is Ireland’s
first "sustainable park" with five 50KW wind turbines set in along
a water feature.<br />
 They harness the wind and provide the energy that powers the
public lighting, maintenance depots, football club changing rooms,
aeration and water features. The turbine rotor diameter is 15
metres, and the overall height to blade tip is 32.5 metres. They
will save an estimated 320 tonnes of CO2 per year.</p>
<p><b>Features of the park include:</b></p>
<p>a skate-park :<br />
A plaza design skate park, the first of its type and size in
Ireland, was designed for street skaters using 3 levels containing
a variety of steps, edges, straight lines and grind rails</p>
<p>2 playgrounds :<br />
The surfaces on the two playgrounds were made from recycled
runners!</p>
<p>6 playing pitches</p>
<p>picnic areas with outdoor chess/draughts boards</p>
<p>6 health/workout stations</p>
<p>a running/cycling track.</p>
<p><b>Cache Info:</b><br />
The difficulty level is subject to change depending on how easy (or
not) it is for people to find. The park is accessible during park
opening times only, which is 10:00 to dusk. There is an FTF prize
of a pathtag (located at the back of the container)<br />
Don't panic and DON'T press the button either (the cache is not on
it) unless of course you need to, (Not being able to locate the
cache doesn't count : ) )</p></long-description>
