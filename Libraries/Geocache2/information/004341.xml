  <description>This cache is located in the secluded Glensoulan valley, beside the
River Dargle. You may approach it along the Wicklow Way from Crone
car park (4 km, 1 hour each way). When you reach the footbridge the
cache is around 160 metres east on the south side of the river.
Please do not attempt to access this location from below
Powerscourt waterfall. The car park is locked at 6 pm each evening
so please allow plenty of time.</description>
  <long-description>Some years ago I discovered an utterly magical place - in the heart
of the forest was a small waterfall feeding a hidden pool of crisp
clear water, perfect for a swim on a hot day walking in the
mountains. Today, the surrounding area is a scene of utter
desolation, thanks to the clear-felling of the forest. Only the
little swimming pool remains unchanged, nestled in its mossy ferny
dreeping grotto, with one or two trees standing as a reminder of
how it once was. 
<p>To find the pool, follow the sound of rushing water 50 metres
further along the south bank of the stream. I highly recommend a
dip, but watch out - the rocks are slippy.</p>
<p>I had planned to name this cache "Desolation", to reflect my
sadness at what has happened to the place. But my little puppy
joined me for a swim in the pool before we placed the cache, and so
the cache has a happier name.</p>
<p>The cache is a small lock-and-lock box. It is hidden well above
the water level to avoid being washed away in winter floods. Please
try not to damage the moss while searching.</p>
<p>Here is an exact description of how to find the cache. At the
co-ordinates is a steep bank. At the base of the bank are two dead
trees; one standing and the other cut down at a height of one
metre. Stand between the two trees with your back to the river.
You'll see an exposed piece of granite rock facing you at or just
above eye-level. The cache is in a hole below and to the right of
the rock, hidden by a plug of moss and some stones. A horizontal
root points in the right direction!</p>
<p>Please rehide carefully making sure to replace the moss!</p>
<p>On the way to the cache you will have wonderful views over
Powerscourt waterfall and have a good chance of meeting some sika
deer. Please be aware of cliffs and steep drops in the area and
take care of children and pets.</p>
