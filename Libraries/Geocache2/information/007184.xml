Located a mere stone's throw from the famous singer's house, this
cache location offers superb views of Killiney Bay and the southern
suburbs of Dublin. It is situated on Killiney Hill, which is linked
to Dalkey Hill and Dalkey Quarry. There is ample parking between
the two hills (at 53 16.150 006 06.624), or you can stroll up from
Killiney or Dalkey Dart stations. The cache is a tupperware
box.<br />
<br />
11/7/04-UPDATE: A recent fire has destroyed the cache site so I've
had to replace it nearby. The new cache location is no longer at
the top of the hill - if the gorse grows back I might re-place it
in its original position. The cache site is easily accessable via a
clear dirt-track off the main tarmac path up from the car park, so
you won't need to go through the undergrowth.<br />
<br />
Some park history, "borrowed" from the internet - <br />
<br />
The park was once part of the estate of Killiney Castle, a
prominent residence in the district. The original house, Mount
Mapas was built in 1740 by Col. John Mapas. The property was owned
in turn by a Mr. Maunsell, Henry Loftus, Viscount of Ely, Lord
Clonmel and Robert Warren, who in 1840 enlarged the house and
called it Killiney Castle. He also restored and added to the
monuments on the hill. The park was purchased from his son, Robert
Warren Jnr. by Queen Victoria's Jubilee Memorial Association. It
was christened Victoria Hill and opened to the public by Prince
Albert on 21/6/1887, the day appointed for celebration of 50th year
of the reign of Queen Victoria. The obelisk at the summit is a
prominent local land mark which bears the following
inscription:-"Last year being hard with the poor walks about these
hills and this were erected by John Mapas, June 1742.<br />
<br />
"Nearby the "Wishing Stone" dated 1852 is of uncertain origin.
Another smaller obelisk a little further along known as Boucher's
obelisk has "Mount Mapas" inscribed on it. It may be a memorial to
the Mapas family for which John Mapas left monies.From 1751 for a
number of years, a lead mine was operated in Killiney Hill from an
opening in the rock near the present Killiney Station, known as
Decco's Cave.<br />
<br />
The Telegraph Tower above Dalkey Quarry was built in 1807 as a
signalling station to communicate with the several Martello Towers
along the coast. It was thus an important element in the defences
against a possible Napoleonic invasion. It was also used to
communicate with ships in the bay. Much of Dalkey village developed
as a result of the work in Dalkey Quarry, which was the source of
granite used for building both locally and abroad. The most
prominent structure whose materials were quarried in Dalkey, is the
East Pier in Dun Laoghaire harbour started in 1817. The stone was
transported from Dalkey via the "Metals" which still exists as a
popular local walkway.<br />
<br />
There is a broken celtic cross near the Radio Beacon atop Dalkey
Quarry. It is said that a previous owner of the property lies
buried there. The cross is inscribed as follows:- "Dust thou art to
dust returneth was not written of the Soul" Thomas Chippendall
Higgin, July 16 MCMXI (1911).<br />
<br />
The "Tea Rooms" at the main Killiney Hill Road entrance, is a stone
lodge built as a keeper's house when the lands belonged to the
castle. Granite outcroppings have been shaped by glaciation into
"roches moutonees" or unusual elongated, rounded units dictated by
the particular direction and pattern of ice flow.About 50% of the
park is covered by mature woodland: trees such as Quercus petraea
(Sessile Oak), Fagus sylvatica (Beech) Pinus radiata (Monterey
Pine), Acer pseudoplatanus (Sycamore), predominate. There is
evidence of regeneration in several locations.There is also a local
variety of ragwort called "Dalkey Ragwort" noted in 1904 in
Colgan's "Flora of Co. Dublin". The plant resulted from
hybridisation of Senecio cineraria maritima and the common ragwort
Senecio jacobea. This is said to have originated from a garden at
Sorrento Cottage in 1875.</long-description>
