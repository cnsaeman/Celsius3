  <description>A nice cache near the Leinster Aquaduct</description>
  <long-description>The Leinster Aquaduct is the crossing point of the Grand Canal over the river Liffey. Built in 1783 by Richard Evans this architectural feat is a tribute the skill of 18th century workmen. 


This is a small cache wrapped in black fabric. Original contents are a pencil, log, and a few small toys. A slippery slope makes this a little difficult.</long-description>
