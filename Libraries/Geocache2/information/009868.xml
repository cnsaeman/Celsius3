  <description>Stop number 27 on the Naas Historic Trail</description>
  <long-description>The first in a proposed series of caches along the canal in Naas. When completed these will be a lovely walk for the family. 

The Ploopluck Bridge is now a pedestrian only bridge on what used to be the Caragh Road. 

The cache is a 35mm film canister. 

Please be sure to rehide the cache carefully. You will need a pen/pencil. STEALTH NEEDED because of muggles on bridge.</long-description>
