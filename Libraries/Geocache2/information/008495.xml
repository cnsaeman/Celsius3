  <description>I HAVE CHANGED THE CO-ORDINATES FOR THIS CACHE.

The old hiding place is no longer usable so I have moved the cache, it is still in the same general area.

A very easy cache. It was difficult to get accurate coordinates because of the trees but that should not put you off.</description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by slands <br />Nice simple find....Lots of cars coming to and from the nearby Scouting centre, so the walk up the road from where I had parked my car was spent constantly hopping into and out of the ditch!

Took a racing geocoin to move on.

Quick find. I don't like the camo on the box though, It doesn't seem necessary given what's hiding the container anyway.
