This cache is one of six in the "Dublin's Railway Termini" series.
The full series, consisting of Westland Row, Amiens Street,
Kingsbridge, North Wall, Broadstone and Harcourt Street will bring
you to the railway termini, both past and present, of Dublin city
and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the vast railway
network that once served the city. Today the railway buildings
remain as impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities. While some of the buildings remain in use
as railway stations, others are sadly neglected relics of Dublin's
railway past. <br />
<br />
Inside the lid of each cache you will find 2 numbers printed in red
and white lettering. Gather all 12 numbers and you will be able to
ascertain the coordinates for an exclusive 7th cache relating to
Dublin's railway history. <br />
<br />
Dublin Pearse, located on Westland Row in the Southside in Dublin,
Ireland, is a DART and Intercity railway station owned by Córas
Iompair Éireann. The station is the terminus of the Northern
Commuter (to Balbriggan/Dundalk) and Western Commuter (to
Maynooth/Longford) services. DART and South Eastern Commuter
(Dublin Connolly to Arklow) services also serve the station, as do
InterCity services from Dublin Connolly to Rosslare Europort.
<br />
<br />
The station was opened on 17 December 1834 as Westland Row station,
the city terminus of the Dublin & Kingstown Railway which was
the first 'commuter' line in the world. The station was extended
and rebuilt in the latter part of the 19th century when the present
overall roof was installed. A feature of this rebuild allowed for
the conversion of the terminus into a through station which
eventually happened when the City of Dublin Junction Railway
completed the final link up of all the city railways. <br />
<br />
The station has two through platforms (Platforms 1 & 2). There
is also one terminal platform (Platform 3) which is occasionally
used for special services. A fourth platform exists, but is
unsuitable for modern passenger services and is used as a siding.
<br />
<br />
It is the headquarters of Iarnród Éireann's DART/Commuter sector.
It is the only one of Dublin's three terminal stations which has
not or is not the subject of a recent major upgrade project, the
others being Connolly and Heuston on the west of the city. <br />
<br />
The station was renamed in 1966 (after the Pearse Family, notably
brothers Patrick and Willie) as part of the Easter Rising
celebrations that saw many of the Republic of Ireland railway
stations renamed. Because of its proximity to Pearse St, many
Dubliners refer to the station as "Pearse Street Station" though
that is not its official name. (In fact, in December 2004, Iarnród
Éireann posted a list of departures from the station headed with
that name). Although a number of Intercity lines operated out of
the station in the past, nowadays no Intercity services regularly
terminate at the station. <br />
<br />
The cache is a magnetic micro. Please replace it as you found it,
ensuring it is not visible. Beware of possible watching eyes in
this area. <br />
