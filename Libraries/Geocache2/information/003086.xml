 CACHE INFORMATION:<br />
The cache is an ammo box covered with black material and placed at
the coordinates above which are on the North side of Lough Dan. To
reach the Pier Gates from Dublin take the Military Road to Sally
Gap and turn left toward Roundwood to arrive at the Gates on your
right. Alternatively travel out from Dublin on the N11 and go right
at Kilmacanogue driving past the Sugarloaf toward Roundwood. At a
sign saying 5K to Roundwood turn right toward Sallygap and arrive
at the Pier Gates on the left shortly after the Wicklow Way
signs.<br />
It is possible to reach this from several other routes, other than
the one suggested here, but they are mostly boggy, tricky walks
which would more than likely take at least as much time. The route
chosen is by far the most scenic. To avoid the many muggles that
can frequent this lovely area I would suggest that you pick a quiet
time other than weekends.<br />
<br />
When I placed this cache, with my wife Joan, I intended that people
should walk to it from the Pier Gates (N53 05.782 W006 15.069)
which is a well known resting point on the Wicklow Way. There is
some parking at that point or nearby and it takes about 45 minutes
to get from there to the cache (especially if a slight shortcut is
taken at N53 05.909 W006 15.565). Add a little more time for the
haul up on the way back. Start by going through the side gate at
the entrance, avoiding the private estate to the left. You descend
on a tarmac road to the short cut above, (you should be able to see
Lough Dan in the distance) then follow the track down till it meets
the road again. If you prefer you could add a little by staying on
the road. The tarmac disappears and becomes a track which later
becomes a grassy path. You should pass two stiles, one stone and
one timber. You should cross two wooden bridges and go through two
old gates. Please be sure to close them behind you. When you reach
the old building that is guarded by a great oak stay to the right
of the wall.<br />
<br />
I placed the cache at 7.00am on a beautiful sunny April morning and
believe me the effort was more than worthwhile. Just about
everything that magnificent County Wicklow has to offer may be
encountered on this medium length walk deep into a glacially
created glen. Fabulous scenery of mountains, river and forest are
home to hundreds of deer. We saw a peregrine falcon, a fox, larks,
dippers and various finches including some glorious Goldfinches
among the many other creatures of the wild. For us it was a truly
spectacular morning walk.<br />
<br />
NO DOGS ALLOWED I’M AFRAID AS THIS IS A NATURE RESERVE!!<br />

 <br />
Lough Dan (Loch Deán in Irish) is a boomerang-shaped ribbon lake
near Roundwood, County Wicklow, Ireland. It is a popular area for
hikers and kayakers and lies very close to the Wicklow Way.<br />
Lough Tay feeds it via the Clohoge river from the north and it is
drained to the south by the Avonmore.<br />
Most of the lake is surrounded by private lands, though the
northwest corner is part of the Wicklow National Park.<br />
<br />
The Cloghoge River flows out of Lough Tay and into Lough Dan. The
Inchavore River flows in another glacial valley from the west to
enter Lough Dan. The scenery around here is spectacular. The valley
floor at 230m is very fertile. The remains of lazy beds, which were
ridges built for growing vegetables, cover the valley. They are
evidence of higher population levels in the mountains in the past.
Arctic Char Salvelinus alpinus was last recorded in the lake in
1988. This fish is the one of the oldest inhabitants of Ireland but
a recent survey found no trace of them, indicating the species is
now extinct in Co. Wicklow. There are Peregrine Falcon sites on the
steep cliffs overlooking the lake on the eastern side, and some
lovely broad-leaved woodland in the Inchavore Valley. The Cloghoge
and Inchavore Rivers are rich in invertebrates and breeding Dippers
and Grey Wagtails can be seen around the river. Herons and
Cormorants roost near the mouth of the Cloghoge River.<br /></long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by Determo <br />Very good cache!
We were hiking from lough dan to crone wood via djouce, so this cache fitted in nicely,
I'd also recommend approaching this cache from the roundwood end of the lake,
Its a nice walk along small trails and paths, the only obsticle is the river at the west end of 
the lake which can sometimes be difficult to cross. 
TFTC  (Determo & Packmule)</li><li>2010-04-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Picked this up after the nearby #29.

Quick find although I approached from the wrong side of the gorse and now I have the scars to prove it!!!

thanks

ginger</li><li>2009-10-17T19:00:00Z : Write note by Kili or bust <br />Just a name change to tie in with the rest of the series.</li><li>2009-09-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by Prefontaine <br />This is what I love about Geocaching....it brings you to places you knew existed but never visited or imagined how amazing they are. This is one of the best cache finds. The walk down to Lough Dan was so beautiful and quiet and it felt like we were transported back in time as there were no cars and the stone walls looked so nostalgic. The deers in the nearby fields were amazed to see us.

After finding the cache we had a picnic under the old oak tree. I climb the old oak tree and it me back to when I was young and I used to do the same thing, climbing the Chestnut Trees at the top of my road.

Thankyou Kili for bringing us here.

We left a floor belt and took nothing
