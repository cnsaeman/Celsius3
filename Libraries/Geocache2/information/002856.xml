<center>Mary, who was out collecting data for the CSO, knocks on
the door of the house. A woman opens the door. Mary asks her how
many children he has. The mother tells Mary that she has three
children and the product of their ages is 36. That is not enough
information for Mary. She asks for more information. The mother
says that the sum of their ages equals the number on the house next
door. Mary thinks that over. She realizes that is still not enough
information; she's fierce clever. So she asks for another clue. The
mother says "the eldest is inside playing the piano." Now Mary
knows the answer. She writes it down, thanks the mother and heads
off on her merry way, thrilled with her mathematical
prowess.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>Work out the following:</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>A: Age of eldest child<br />
B: Age of second child<br />

We tried to find this cache a couple of weeks ago with no joy as we didn't have the right co-ords! We had the right answers to the puzzle, but our maths let us down. Today we came to finish the job. We found the cache not far from were we had been searching the other day. When I (Abbey) found the cache and went to retrieve the container I scratched my hand up on some brambles - owey! [B)] While I cursed my need to find tupperware in the woods [:o)] , Ackbar signed the log and replaced the cache unscathed.

Nice walk by the river too.
