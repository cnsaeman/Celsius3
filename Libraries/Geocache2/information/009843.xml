  <description>2-stage multi in a forest in South County Dublin. The cache is a
small (0.7 l) plastic lock-and-lock style box. 
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Part of the challenge is to figure out how to get
to the co-ordinates so I am not providing directions for this
cache.</p>
Although the location is generally very peaceful, some nearby areas
are a little "rough" so be alert for any "anti-social behaviour",
and if you feel nervous come back another time.</description>
  <long-description><p><b>Long description</b></p>
This little-known forest on the edge of suburbia has many different
kinds of trees and wildlife, including sika deer, badgers, rabbits
and squirrels, as well as newts. Part of the area is mixed forest,
another part is open grassland and a third part has gorse, ferns
and ponds. While the older trees are mainly birch, there are lots
of other species such as oak, ash, holly, blackthorn, and hawthorn.
Areas of meadow within the wood have many meadow flowers such as
rosebay willow-herb, and support many butterflies. Birdlife
includes peregrine falcons, various finches and warblers and even
jays. 
<p>These 8 hectares have been the subject of a protracted battle
between development and conservation. The survival of the wood is
now assured.</p>
<p>The above co-ordinates will lead you to a granite rock in an
open area in the middle of the forest. This is only 10 minutes walk
from my house, and I often come here in the evening with my dog.
This rock is a good place to sit for a while and listen to the
sounds of nature.</p>
<p><b>Calculate the Final Co-ordinates</b></p>
<p>Someone has carved two "calendrical" letters into the rock,
seemingly using an angle grinder! These two letters will provide
the information you need to find the final stage where the cache is
hidden.</p>
<p>Using the system A=1, B=2, C=3, etc., what is the number
corresponding to the first letter? Call this number <b>W</b>.</p>
<p>Using the same system, what is the number corresponding to the
second letter? Call this number <b>X</b>.</p>
<p><br>
How many "strokes" (or lines) were used to carve the first letter?
Call this number <b>Y</b>.</p>
<p><br>
How many "strokes" (or lines) were used to carve the second letter?
Call this number <b>Z</b>.</p>
<p><br>
Now, you may find the cache at the following co-ordinates:</p>
<p>N53°16.[Y-X][W+X][X]</p>
<p>W6°13.[X+Y][Y+Z-W][Z-W+X]</p>
<p>Check: the six digits you've calculated should sum to 29.</p>
Now, to reach the final stage, look up (to your north) and you'll
see 38kV electricity cables crossing the path. Follow the line of
the electricity cables - this will bring you near the cache. 
<p><b>Pheasantberries</b></p>
<p>Among the many edible plants in this forest are some
pheasantberry bushes (Leycesteria formosa). You can find some
nearby at N53°16.034 W006°14.031. These are native to the
Himalayas, and also known as "Himalayan Honeysuckle". In summer
they bear beautiful red and white flowers or "bracts" shaped like
hanging pagodas. In autumn they have brown berries, which
astonishingly taste like burnt caramel or chocolate. In fact, in
German they are called Karamelbeere. Needless to say, no wild foods
should be eaten unless you are absolutely sure you have positively
identified the species and know it to be edible.</p>
<p><b>Note on Trading</b></p>
<p>Normal trading rules do not apply to this cache. If you find
something that takes your fancy or would be useful to you, please
take it even if you don't have anything to trade.</p></long-description>
