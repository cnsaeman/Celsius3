On a nice Summer day this would be a good walk in the Garden County
with about half of the hike on firm forest tracks and the rest
across rough open moorland. The hike of approx 10K should take a
little more than 3 hours and has a total ascent of 550m. Please
note the red type below and make sure to have all the proper gear.
I have shown it as a linear walk in the map above (the easiest and
most direct way to get there and back) but there are several ways
to make it a circuit if you wish. I would avoid coming back from
the Duff Hill direction to the East as returning to the start point
from the valley on that side is extremely soggy and tricky.<br />
There are two stages to be found which will provide the exact
coordinates for the final cache which is located at Cleevaun Lough.
The Lough, one of the highest in Wicklow, is situated in a
depression about 250 mtres below the summit of Mullaghcleevaun so
there is an opportunity to claim Hezekiah's cache near the summit
too as well as his cache on Mullacleevaun East Top.<br />
<br />
At the car park you will see a higher and a lower forest track
heading in the direction of Stage 1. Take the lower one (on the
left as you look). It is a straight forward walk on forest track to
find Stage 1 but after passing through a gate (please be sure to
close it after you) then turn right up a grass path and through a
barrier at N53 08.448 W006 25.354 as this is the only correct
route.<br />
<font color="red"><font size="4">Please note that there may be
clear signs for sport shooting (presumably deer culling) at certain
times of year so please avoid these times which are
rare.<br /></font></font><br />
At Stage 1 N53 08.131 W006 25.244 (post on the right before
reaching the next gate) you will find the last 3 numbers of the
first half of the final coordinates. Please take them down in the
order they appear and call them ABC.<br />
After making sure to CLOSE the gate, continue along the forest
track to Stage 2 at the edge of the forest.<br />
At Stage 2 N53 07.365 W006 24.980 you will find another gate which
leads out on to the mountain terrain. Here you will find the end of
the second half of the final coordinates close to the gate. Call
these DEF<br />
Putting the two together to make up the final coordinates N53
06.ABC W006 24.DEF, you should cross the gate and then a small
stream and head across rising mountain terrain in the the direction
of Mullacleevaun which is the highest of the mountains in front of
you (though not always clearly visible from here).<br />
The going can be soft in the early part of this moorland hike after
wet conditions but it improves as you reach higher ground.<br />
Please note that, after you reach and find the cache, you will be
returning to this gate (so keep a careful note of the Stage 2
coordinates for your directions) to follow the forest track back to
the car park.<br />

Joyce says it is named after a cradle-like depression near the top,
presumably the one occupied by Cleevaun Lough. Mullaghcleevaun is
the second highest mountain in the Dublin/Wicklow area and the 20th
highest in Ireland.<br />
<font color="red"><font size="4">Do not start the trek without all
the proper mountain rain gear, waterproof boots and the guidance
material, compass, map, GPSr with mapping etc. Please note that all
parts of this cache are hiked at your own risk. The cache owner

accidents or mishaps.<br /></font></font><br />

Please observe the country code to the best of your ability. Local
landowners often generously allow access to upland areas across or
through parts of their private property. Please, please be
conscious of this and return the courtesy by keeping all gates
closed, immediately and not on your way back!. Please use the gates
where appropriate but if you have to climb over them then use the
hinged side ONLY.<br />
