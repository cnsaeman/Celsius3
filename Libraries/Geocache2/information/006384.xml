  <description>Very easy cache with handy parking. Mind the nettles. 
As a child I was told that once upon a time there was a Tea Room here that burnt down. All that remains is one dilapidated gate post.</description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by slands <br />Nice simple find on a very wet day. Had to retire to the nearby trees to get some shelter to sign the "log" - this is just a sheet of paper now as the original log, and most of the rest of the contents were quite damp.
