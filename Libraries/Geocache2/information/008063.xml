  <description>Regular cache near the summit of Maulin. Cache is <b>not</b> in the
stone wall.</description>
  <long-description>This was to be the first of three caches I would hide. However due
to bad weather it was only possible to place this one. And I don't
even have any pictures as the camera battery died and the backup
battery didn't work either. It was one of those days! 
<p>Heres a picture of the cache and the hills on a better day!<br>

<p>Maulin is one of the smaller mountains in Wicklow at 570m. The
Wicklow Way passes just to the East of it and following that route
to the hills to the south is a more popular route. However the
views from Maulin are worth the detour. The whole Glensoulan valley
is visible almost as far as Sally Gap, and bring a pair of
binoculars to try and pick out deer in the valley.</p>
<p>The easiest way to approach the cache is by driving to Crón Wood
car park. In summer this car park closes at 8pm; earlier in Winter.
From the car park you make your way through the forest trails
towards Maulin. As you leave the forest you can follow paths that
will take you to the summit. The cache is placed a little distance
from the summit.</p>
<p>The closest Public Transport is in the village of Eniskerry. If
you take the public transport route I would advise that you stay
overnight in the hostel in Knockree and use this as a base to
explore some nearby caches. As with all caches in the Wicklow
Mountains remember to have a sturdy pair of boots, a compass and,
the Sheet 56 map.</p>
<p>The logs below mention an issue with the coords. This has been
rectified and the coords given above are correct. Thanks!</p>
