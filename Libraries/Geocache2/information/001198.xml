<p><b>Never heard of Firefly? Here's why</b></p>
<p>Firefly is a space western tv series created by writer and
director Joss Whedon. It premiered in the United States and Canada
on the Fox network on Sept. 20, 2002 & a whole 3 months and 14
episodes later (only 11 of which were aired), the show was
cancelled, and that is where the story should have ended, but it
didn't.</p></description>
  <long-description><p>The ratings for the show were low (averaging only 4.7 MILLION
viewers per episode!! and was 98th in the Nielsen Ratings) and Gail
Berman of Fox was quoted in a national publication admitting that
some of the problems with Firefly's ratings could be attributed to
the way Fox had handled the program. The episodes were not aired in
the order that the creators had intended. Most notably, the 2hr
episode 'Serenity' was intended to be the pilot episode, as it
contained most of the character introductions and back-story.
However, Fox decided that 'Serenity' was not a suitable pilot, and
so the second episode, 'The Train Job', was rushed into production
to become the pilot episode.</p>
<p>Following huge fan support campaigns after the show was
cancelled, Whedon and Universal Pictures went on to produce a film
based on the series, called 'Serenity' shown in cinemas worldwide
in 2005.</p>
<p><b>About the Firefly cache series</b></p>
<p>We have created this Firefly series out of our love of the show
and its' characters. There are 11 caches in the series. Firstly the
'Firefly' cache, which is an introduction to the show. Then there
is a cache created around each member of the Firefly crew and
finally there's a bonus cache, the 'Serenity' cache.</p>
<p>Below you'll find a list of the main characters in Firefly, each
with their own picture link to that character's cache page (as they
get published :) ).</p>
<p>Obviously you don&#8217;t have to have seen either the tv show
or the movie to find these caches but there are a few
Firefly/Serenity references throughout the caches for fellow
Browncoats out there, and although you may never get to see a
single Firefly episode or the movie, Serenity, we hope you enjoy
the Firefly caches and the locations they bring you to.</p>
<p>To all you Browncoat Geocachers out there....well...I don't
believe there's a power in the verse could stop you from finding
these gorram caches! and remember - can't stop the signal : )</p>
<p><b>About Firefly</b></p>
<p>The series is set in the year 2517, and follows the adventures
of the renegade crew of Serenity, a "Firefly-class" spaceship.</p>
<br />

<p>It is a future where the only 2 surviving superpowers, the
United States and China, fused to form the central federal
government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two
cultures as well. The captain of Serenity, Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds,
is the veteran of a war of resistance against "The
Alliance"&#8212;an organization that attempted to achieve the
unification of all mankind under a single imperial government.</p>
<p>The ship was named after the Battle of Serenity Valley, where
the characters Mal and Zoe fought as Independents (aka Browncoats)
against the Alliance. The battle was part of the Unification War, a
failed attempt by the outlying worlds to resist the Alliance's
assertion of control. The Battle of Serenity Valley is widely
considered the loss which sealed the fate of the Independents.
Throughout the series, the Alliance is shown to govern the star
system through an organization of "core" planets, following its
success in forcibly unifying all the colonies under a single
government.</p>
<p>Mal now owns the small Firefly-class starship
&#8216;Serenity&#8217;. In one of the episodes, titled "Out of
Gas", it is revealed that Mal bought the spaceship Serenity to
continue living beyond Alliance control. Much of the crew's work
consists of cargo runs and performing various other
tasks&#8212;legal or otherwise&#8212;to scrape together a living
for himself and his crew.</p>
<p>Featuring a blend of elements from science fiction and western
genres, the show depicts mankind's future in a way that is
uncharacteristic of many sci-fi shows. The brilliant dialogue and
interplay between characters is central to the plot of the show,
resulting in a story that is alternately serious and humorous and
brilliant to watch.</p>
