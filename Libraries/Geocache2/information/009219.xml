  <description>Stop number 5 on the Naas Historic Trail</description>
  <long-description>The Abbey Bridge was built in 1789 over the newly completed Naas Extension of the Royal Canal. Its name comes from the fact that, according to some sources, it was built of stones from an old Abbey nearby. 

This cache is part of a series that would make a great family walking outing. 

This is a micro-cache in a 35mm film canister with room only for a log. Please bring along a pen/pencil.</long-description>
