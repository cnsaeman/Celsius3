Like most of the Liffey Bridge caches this is a magnetic micro. You
will need a pen or pencil. The coordinates above bring you to the
area only. The cache can be found quite easlily witout accurate
coordinates but if you require more precise information then answer
the following:<br />
<br />
What is the street number of the Croppy Bar? Call the answer
"A".<br />
 The Croppy Bar has since gone but it may just add to the fun to
leave cachers to find without it! Cache find is very easy anyhow.
<br />
The final coordinates are N53 20.829-A W006 17.021+A<br />
PLEASE REPLACE CAREFULLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER AND MAKE SURE IT IS
CLOSED PROPERLY. PLEASE ALSO REPLACE THE CACHE EXACTLY WHERE YOU
FOUND IT. <br />

 Usher’s Island and Rory O’Moore Bridge.<br />
Opened in 1860 as the Victoria Bridge, it was renamed in 1922 after
a leader of the uprising of 1641. Inscribed on the arch the words:
Robert Daglish Junr St Helens Foundry Lancashire. The famous
Guinness brewery is visible behind.<br />
Previously the bridge was painted white, and the name of the
manufacturer wasn't clear. This is an attractive piece of
mid-Victorian British engineering. <br />
<br />
James Joyce’s most famous short story “The Dead” (Dubliners) was
written describing a dinner party (“the dinner party of the
century”) and set at 15 Usher’s Island on the south bank of the
river Liffey. The dinner party is often re-created as part of the
James Joyce celebrations on Bloomsday.<br />
The house used in his work 'The Dead', has become a landmark of
historical importance. The house is now open to the public who can
imagine the characters of this musical that also opened
off-Broadway in 1998. An art gallery has been introduced into this
house to exhibit works of known and unknown artists and to promote
creative talent in Dublin. Entry fee is €5.<br />
<br />
Rory O’Moore and the Ancient Order of Hibernians This organization
grew up gradually among the Catholics of Ireland owing to the
dreadful hardships and persecutions to which they were subjected.
It is impossible to give the exact date of the foundation of the
order in Ireland. Some authorities contend that the first impulse
towards forming such an association was due to the publication of
an edict against the Catholic religion by the Earl of Sussex
(Thomas Radcliffe), who was made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in
1562. He prohibited all monks and Catholic priests from either
eating or sleeping in Dublin, and ordered the head of each family
to attend Protestant services every Sunday, under the penalty of a
fine. Not only did the English begin a bitter persecution of the
Catholics, they also confiscated the property of the Irish nobles.
The prince Rory O'Moore with his companions took up the cause of
religion and the protection of the priesthood as well as the
defence of their dominions, and through their asssistance the
priests said Mass, on the mountains, in the valleys and glens,
while "The Defenders", as they were called, acted as faithful
sentinels to guard them from danger. The principality ruled over by
Rory O'Moore was called Leix; it covered the greater part of
Queen's County and part of County Kildare. The O'Moore's belonged
to the Clan Rory of the Province of Ulster, and were descended from
the celebrated hero, Conall Cearnach, who was the chieftain of the
Red Branch Knights at the beginning of the Christian Era. This
famous Rory O'Moore was victorious over the English forces in many
battles during the reigns of Queens Mary and Elizabeth, and in
consequence recovered the principality of Leix, which had been the
property of his forefathers and which he governed until his death
in 1578.<br /></long-description>
