  <long-description><p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>In order to find the cache you must solve this puzzle<br />
 Be prepared to spend some time hunting the location<br />
 As I won't be confirming the correct coordinates for you<br />

  <logs><ul><li>2010-03-13T20:00:00Z : Found it by Frezeluberz <br />As I log this I see that no one has found it since 2008.
Wish I'd come to get it last year.
That would have made this one and Las Vegas in the Hills the only caches with us as the visitors in 2009 ... damn.
I solved this a long time ago but never seemed to take the time off the motorway to grab it.
Very glad previous people had made the effort to try and find this and highlighted that there were more than one solution.
I heard Fjon's post and skipped the first two I found.
A little while later ... maybe three days the penny dropped and back I came to see if I was right and what d'ye' know ... bingo ;)

Eventually the name got to me and we made the detour.
Arrived close to GZ in the dark.
Out of the car, round to the boot and out come the ... um ... torches?  Where are the torches?
Damn - left them at home - got the car serviced earlier in the week and forgot to put the geocaching pruck back in the boot :(
Never mind, we'll give it a go in the dark ... by phone light.
Got to GZ and we were happy about the location ... seemed a valid spot to hide a cache.
Started looking ... and looking ... and looking, but seriously, the light on our phones are pants.
Caved in and phoned Mr Windsockers for a tip.
We weren't far off the cache it would seem.
Told him what we were near, and what object we were beside and he tried his best to describe what we're meant to be looking for ... in the dark.
Got off the phone and the hunt began again.
After quite some considerable time we did manage to find the little critter.
Haven't seen a cache container quite like this one.
Enjoyed the puzzle and glad we made the detour to finally put this one to bed.
No more Nagging Cache for me.
