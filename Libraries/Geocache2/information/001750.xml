<p><b><i>Malahide</i></b></p>
<p>Malahide, Irish <i>Mullach Ide</i> is situated 16 kilometres
north of the city of Dublin, lying between Swords, Kinsealy and
Portmarnock and is still a popular spot for day-trippers,
especially in the summer months. It is situated on the Broadmeadow
estuary, on the opposite side of which is Donabate.</p>
<p>Malahide is known to have become a persistent settlement from
the coming of the Vikings, who landed in 795, and used Malahide
Estuary (along with Baldoyle) as a convenient base. With the
arrival of the Anglo-Normans, the last Danish King of Dublin
retired to the area in 1171. From the 1180s, the history of the
area is tied to that of the Talbot family of Malahide Castle, who
were granted extensive lands in the area and over the centuries
following developed their estate, and the small harbour
settlement.</p>
<p><b><i>The cache</i></b></p>
<p>The cache is a micro container with logbook, please bring your
own pen . Please rehide it well to prevent many muggles from
discovering it.</p></long-description>
