  <long-description><p>The Casino at Marino, located in Marino, Dublin, Ireland was
designed by Scottish architect Sir William Chambers for James
Caulfeild, the 1st Earl of Charlemont, starting in the late 1750s
and finishing around 1775. It is a small and perfect example of
Neo-Classical architecture, situated in the gardens of Marino
House. Although proud of the design, it is notable that due to his
constant employment in England, Chambers was never able to visit
the completed building.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>The name 'Casino Marino' is derived from Italian which literally
translates to 'The small house by the small sea'. Widely regarded
as the most important Neo-Classical building in Ireland, the Casino
is actually quite small, measuring only fifty feet square to the
outer columns. In plan, it takes the form of a Greek Cross with a
pair of columns framing each projecting elevation. Seen from the
outside, the building has the appearance of a single roomed
structure, with a large panelled door on the north elevation and a
single large window on each of the other elevations. This is all
illusion, however, as it actually contains 16 rooms on three
floors. Only two of the panels in the door open to allow entrance,
and the panes of glass in the windows are subtly curved, disguising
the partitioning which allows what looks like a single window to
serve several separate rooms.</p>
<br />
<p>Many other tricks are used throughout the construction in order
to preserve the apparent simplicity of the design. Four of the
columns which surround the building are hollow and used to drain
rainwater from the roof, and Roman funerary urns on the roof are
used as chimneys.</p>
<br />
<p>The interior includes a basement level with a kitchen and
associated rooms, a main floor with reception rooms and a top
storey with servants rooms and a State Bedroom. It contains some
very fine plasterwork ceilings and some elaborate hardwood parquet
floors.</p>
<br />
<p>Important- Opening hours for the house vary throughout the year.
However the cache is accessible 24 hour. Stealth is required due to
the close proximity of houses. Thanks.</p>
<br />
<p>Finally, in case you are wondering. Casino Marino has nothing to
do with gambling!</p>

TFTC!</li><li>2009-07-04T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Out for a bit of an afternoon bike ride and decided to pop in. I've seen this place in a couple of guide books, although C knew nothing of it. SInce we arrived a few minutes before a tour was to start we paid the tiny entrance fee to see the inside. Beautiful building - although must say that I love the kitchens more than the rest! After our tour we grabbed the cache rather quickly. Log book was rather damp, which is no surprise given the storms a few nights ago. </li></ul></logs>
