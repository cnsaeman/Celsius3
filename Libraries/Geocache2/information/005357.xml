  <long-description>A simple cache in a County Kildare town which is fast becoming
another suburb of sprawling Dublin. For the moment though it still
retains a little of it's rural nature. The cache site is a very old
remnant of that past but it is surrounded by all the trappings of
modern progress as well. A very easy one!</long-description>
