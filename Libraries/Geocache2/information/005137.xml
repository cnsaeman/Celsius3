  <long-description>Not too difficult to find but some last minute circle-spinning may
be required! Please approach and replace the cache with care as
this is a sensitive historical area. Depending on the time of year,
the approach to the cache site can be slippery so appropriate
footwear is recommended. It is likely that it was this second Hugh
de Lacy who erected that large moat that stands out so prominently
adjacent to the Catholic Church in the village. The site was well
chosen. The summit commands a view of most of the barony. It had
all the other characteristics of the typical Norman fort – a keep.
Bailium, fosse, etc. The Normans had to defend themselves in a new
country that was thinly populated and almost without roads. They
set up their own courts to administer justice and keep the peace.
As in England, the native population in the area made no
resistance. It was not so along the borders where the native kings
raided the Norman territory just as they raided and were raided by
their neighbours. Before long Ratoath was well inside the Norman
territory and it was not necessary for them to build a stone castle
for defence such as they erected at Duleek, Slane, Dunshaughlin,
etc. It may have been this Hugh de Lacy too, that erected the first
Church in Ratoath as the site in the old cemetery was just then
right by Norman practice. On the other hand, the fact that’s patron
is the Most Holy Trinity suggests either as earlier foundation, as
the Normans usually dedicated their churches to Our Blessed Lady or
to one of the saints, or that they borrowed the title from an
existing church in the neighbourhood. Don't forget to record your
visit in the log book and on the geocaching web site later. Thanks.
Enjoy.</long-description>
