  <long-description><center><b>Lothe</b> him or <b>lothe</b> him, Chris de Burgh came
to mind when I paid this place a visit with thoughts of using it
for a cache site.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>The coordinates given will bring you to the churchyard. In
order to calculate the final coordinates of the cache you'll need
to visit the sign by the door and then find the preacher's
daughter.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>Call the digits on the sign <b>ABCD</b>.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>When you find the preacher's daughter, the number of
letters in her surname will be <b>E</b>.</center>
<center>The number of letters in her siblings names will be
<b>F</b>.</center>
<center>The number of people named will be <b>G</b>.</center>
<center>The number of people interred here will be
<b>H</b>.</center>
<center>&nbsp;</center>
<center>The final coordinates are:</center>
<center>N 53° (C+A)*E.(G+B)FE</center>
<center>W 6° C+G*4.E*F*2-(E-H)*G+H</center>

Letters to the Irish Times were not pleased [:(!].

I don’t have much opinion about him, I do remember a teacher of mine at primary school trying to teach our class the lyrics of ‘Don’t Pay The Ferryman’.  He has had one or two good songs and one or two dodgy ones also.

I was amazed I got the maths right on the first go, the West co ord is a bit complicated, what are the rules about the hierarchy of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division again[?] TFTC, TNLNSL. Serapis.
