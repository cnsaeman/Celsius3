  <long-description><p>Underneath the communication masts on Three Rock Mountain are
the three granite tors that lend the mountain its name. The centre
one of these has three bullauns (a bullaun is a man-made
depression)in its upper surface. These prompted Gabriel Beranger,
an eighteenth century antiquarian, to speculate that they may have
been used as sacrificial altars.</p>
<p>He wrote "This mountain has on its summit three large heaps of
rock, piled one on another, and seen at some miles distance, from
which the mountain takes its name. I take them to be altars on
which sacrifices were offered....... I have copied every stone as
they are fixed, and the regularity which is observed in piling them
convinces me that they are the work of man, as they could not grow
in that position...... The extensive summit of this mountain, the
parched ground and its solitude, make it the most awful spot I had
ever seen."</p>
<p>It would be interesting to get his views on the mountain as it
now is!</p>
<p>Parking is plentiful at N53º 15.221 W 006º 14.798 - the walk to
the cache is about 15 - 20 minutes.</p></long-description>
