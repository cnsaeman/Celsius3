<br />
 This cache is located on the West Pier in Dun Laoghaire in South
County Dublin. The town of Dun Laoghaire is pleasant enough, but
the seafront area is most relaxing and scenic. The East Pier is the
more popular and well kept of the two piers in Dun Laoghaire, but
the West Pier has a peaceful charm to it. The views across Dublin
Bay to Howth are worth the visit. Bring binoculars to fully enjoy
the views. There are several transport links to the cache. It can
be reached from the Salthill / Monkstown DART station, the 7, 46a
and 75 buses, as well as the ferry from Holyhead!<br />
<br />
 The cache is a very small tupperware box (9cm x 9cm x 3cm), so
please only bring small items. <br />
<br />
The cache site might be difficult to find, so it might be worth
printing the spoiler photo. Apologies for the long
clue...</long-description>
