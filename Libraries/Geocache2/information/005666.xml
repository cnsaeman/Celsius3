  <long-description><p>This is a linear park on the banks of the Ward River South of
Swords town. It covers an area of 89 ha. (220 acres) between Swords
Town Centre and Knocksedan Bridge. Features of interest include
some 12th century fortifications, woodland habitats, wetlands and
rolling grassland. There are viewing points, picnic sites, a public
playground, sports pitches and tennis courts.</p>
<center>&nbsp;</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>Opening Hours:</p>
<p>The park is open all year round during the following hours:</p>
<p>November to January: 10.00am - 5.00pm<br />
February to March 10.00am - 6.00pm<br />
April 10.00am - 7.00pm<br />
May 10.00am - 8.00pm<br />
June to August 10.00am - 9.00pm<br />
September 10.00am - 8.00pm<br />
October 10.00am - 7.00pm</p>
<center><b><font size="+1">The Cache</font></b></center>
<br />
 
<p>The cache is located in the wild west end of the park. The level
of difficulty may depend on, and change according to, your chosen
starting point and your tolerance of the wonderful aroma of wild
garlic in the spring. Many of the paths at this end of the park can
be steep, overgrown, muddy and slippy.</p>
<p>The cache can be approached by the direct method or by using the
two waypoints which will bring you to the cache by an easier route.
The coordinates were averaged 150 times to an accuracy of 2.7
metres; hopefully helping with satellite reception under the
trees.</p>
<br />
The cache is a waterproof container of about a litre in
capacity.<br />

N 53° 27.413 W 006° 15.190
Distance From Old: 515.4 feet
Having read some of the finds and DNFs particularly those relating to fences and being overlooked I moved the cache to a accessible location. Visiting the site was more difficult than when placed and the easiest way to the cache was blocked by fencing and barbed wire that had not been there previously. I got to the cache without crossing any fences but there was a large Trespassers Prosecuted sign very close by.

The new location is about 150 metres east of the original location.

New coordinates: N 53° 27.438 W 006° 15.054

Old coordinates: N 53° 27.413 W 006° 15.190

The No Trespassing signs here are a bit worrying - is this not someone's back garden?
Found the cache with some help. There is no garlic now, but I imagine it's great when there is.</li></ul></logs>
