#216 </li><li>2010-04-26T19:00:00Z : Found it by Blue Jay 59 <br />There is a very obvious location at the listed co-ords - but that's not where the cache is [:D] Spoke to a previous finder who helped with this one.  He confirmed the co-ords are way off. So armed with that knowledge and a hint for the location, we re-visited it and found it in the obvious place at the new co-ords.
For us:  N 53째 19.117 W 006째 18.976 worked, & don't beat about the bush.

#316</li><li>2009-05-24T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Possibly the only glorious summers day of the year so naturally we were out on the bikes and off to do some caching. Cache easily found. Unfortunately it looks as though the debris mentioned in the previous log had not been dealt with. </li></ul></logs>
