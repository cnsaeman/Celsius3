  <long-description>Airfield was the home of the Overend family, most recently Letitia
and Naomi (sisters), who lived there for their entire lives. They
were very well known characters in the Dundrum locality, mainly
thanks to their beautiful range of vintage cars, their pedigree
herd of Jersey cows and, of course, for their altruistic
endeavours, of which Airfield is a living testament. You can walk
around the grounds and admire gardens, animals and cars, enjoy a
meal in the restaurant or do some shopping - or you can stay in the
car park and find the cache! There is an admission charge to the
grounds, but it's worth it - take the time to view the estate.
(&euro;6 for adults; &euro;3 for children - there are group and
concession rates available also. The estate is open Tuesday to
Saturday 10 - 4; Sunday and Bank Holidays 11 - 4). More info at
