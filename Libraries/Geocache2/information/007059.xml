TFTC</li><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by kaputing <br />Pile of rocks in now a collection of slabs. We found more of the contents of the cache and put them in. Signed sheet. Cache safe but could really do with a spruce up. Fantastic location with a lovely view of my old house.
Thanks for it.
