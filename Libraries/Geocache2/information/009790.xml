  <long-description><p>The foundation of the Belfast and Dublin societies of United
Irishmen took place in the Autumn of 1791. This initially reformist
organisation demanded democratic reforms including Catholic
emancipation. In response to popular pressure the British
government which effectively ruled Ireland initially granted some
reforms. This period of reform ended in 1793 when war broke out
between revolutionary France and Britain. The United Irishmen's
journey to revolutionary separatism was only completed with the
Cave Hill oath of June 1795. From this time on their program was
for a revolution that with French backing would break the
connection with Britain and usher in democratic reform.</p>
<p>In December of 1796 the United Irishmen came the nearest they
would to victory when 15,000 French troops arrived off Bantry Bay.
Only the bad weather and poor seamanship of the Jacobean sailors
prevented the landing and saved Britain from defeat. After Bantry
Bay Irish society was bitterly polarised as loyalists flocked to
join the British army and the United Irishmen's numbers swelled
massively.</p>
<p>By the Spring of 1798 a campaign of British terror was
destroying the United Irishmen organisation and many of the leaders
had been arrested. The remaining leaders felt forced to call an
immediate rising, before French aid would arrive. The date was set
for May 23rd. A series of factors undermined the rising in Dublin.
However it sparked major risings in Wexford in the south and Antrim
and Down in the North. These saw large scale battles in which tens
of thousands participated. Elsewhere there were minor skirmishes
particularly around Dublin. After the defeat of the main risings a
small French Army landed on the west coast of Ireland at Killala on
August the 22nd. Although there was almost no revolutionary
organisation in that area thousands flocked to join them and the
subsequent army succeeded in inflicting one major defeat on the
British. By the Autumn the rebellion had been defeated, tens of
thousands were dead and a reign of terror had spread over the
country.</p>
