  <long-description><p><b>Kenure House and Demesne</b></p>
<p>For centuries Kenure House and its woodland dominated the
skyline and the life of nearby Rush. Not that the inhabitants of
Rush were ever fully dominated by any great landowners, whoever
they might be. Having made their living for centuries from the sea
and from the fertile land of the region, their relationship with
their great landowners was a respectfully independent one. As far
back as the early 16th Century, the fishermen of Rush exhorted the
owners of Kenure to secure a safe harbour for their boats, saying
that otherwise they would have to seek employment elsewhere and "no
longer dwell in this habitation".</p>
<img src="http://www.northbeach.ie/gallery/albums/userpics/10001/normal_kenure_inside_2.jpg" />
 
<p align="left">In 1964 the contents of Kenure House were
auctioned, and the estate, which was also known as Kenure Park, was
sold to the Irish Land Commission. Colonel R. H. Fenwick-Palmer,
the last of the Palmers to live in the house, had decided to
abandon the losing battle against rising costs, dry rot and rising
damp. Within a short while the house was handed over to Dublin
County Council, who, unable to find a buyer for it, in its
increasingly dilapidated and vandalized condition, were finally
obliged to demolish it for safety reasons in 1978.</p>
<br />

<br />

<p align="left">The tragedy of the demise of Kenure House is that
the house, walled gardens and woodland, were equal, if not
superior, in architecture, natural beauty and history, to other
estates in the Fingal area, estates like Ardgillan or New bridge
House, which have since been acquired as public amenities. The sale
of Kenure House by the Palmer family came that few years too early
for such enlightened planning.</p>
<br />
<p align="left">The development of St.Catherine's housing estate on
the site of the house and much of the park has brought new blood to
the town of Rush. The strange sight of an enormous portico puzzles
many people, standing as it does, alone against the sky. (At the
time of its demolition, a number of Rush people did protest, and
managed to prevent at least the portico from being destroyed.)
People ask themselves what was the house itself like, who were the
privileged ones who trod its halls, or drove their carriages along
its avenues?</p>
<p>Traces of a ruined castle which perhaps predate the later Norman
dwellings can be seen near the cache location. However, it is since
Norman times, when Ireland was divided up as payments to Henry II's
Norman lords, that we have a clearer picture of Kenure's past.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>At the above location take note of the round pillars of the
portico call this number <b>A</b><br />
Also take note of the number of square pillars of the portico call
this number <b>B</b></p>
<p>The Cache is located at N53 3B.(A-B)/2(A-B)/2 7 W6
05.(A-B)(A-B)0</p>
<p>Please re hide the cache with care to prevent young muggles from
finding it</p>

A year since it was last found - I love getting caches like this :)
We did find the portico a strange sight to behold sitting there all alone.

Took a bit of a hunt after giving the kids time to play in the playground.
The weather was great today - who said it was going to rain?!
Gotta say one thing though - getting Zoe andDaddy & gilliancclarke to do multis is a nightmare!!
I don't think they like them much!
