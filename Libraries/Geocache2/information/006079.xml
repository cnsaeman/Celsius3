  <long-description>Dublin's latest and controversial attraction located in the
position formerly occupied by Nelson's Pillar. To log a find post a
photo of yourself with your GPSr with this wonderful
attraction.<br />
<br />
 The Spike is a winning design by Ian Ritchie Architects of London
chosen from an international field of 205 entries. The majority of
the entries were from Ireland but were also received from Europe,
America and even Iran. The field was short listed to three,
Jonathan Bennett, Dublin based architect, Ian Ritchie Architects of
London and Hunt McGarry, Architects, also based in London. <br />
<br />
 The Spike is a conical spire of rolled stainless steel plate which
tapers from 3 metres in diameter at the base to a 0.1 metre pointed
pinnacle at a height of 120 metres. The top 12 metres of the
structure is illuminated from within and the top 500 mm of the
structure is made of conically cast optical glass. <br />
<br />
 The upper part of the monument will gently sway in direct response
to the wind reflecting the character of its climate, landscape and
people. <br />
