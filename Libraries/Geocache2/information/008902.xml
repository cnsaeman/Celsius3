  <long-description><p>Named after the Fitzwilliam family, Earls of Merrion, who
developed this land as part of their great estate on the southside
of the Liffey, this estate was laid out between 1760 and 1850. The
land acquired by the Fitzwilliam family was leased from the City
Corporation and as it was a single block, this lent it a
cohesiveness that was lacking in the Gardiner Estate, which was
developed and bought in small parcels.</p>
<p>Nearby Fitzwilliam Street was once the longest expanse of intact
Georgian architecture anywhere in the world, but was destroyed in
the 1970s when the ESB knocked a row of houses to develop a new
Head Office</p></long-description>
