  <long-description><p><b>Evan's Tower</b></p>
<p>In the grounds of St Ita's Hospital, stands a one hundred foot
round tower. It was built by Sophie Evans in memory of her husband,
George Evans M.P. who died in 1844. The door to to the Tower stands
15 feet from the ground (See Photo by Fr Aquinas T. Duffy).
Originally there was also a marble bust of George Evans inside the
Tower with the inscription "To the memory of George Evans M.P., an
honest man, firm friend and true patriot. This monument a rivival
of the ancient architecture of his country, is respectfully,
affectionately and mournfully dedicated". This bust was later taken
by Professor Pritchard Evans of Oxford University.</p>
<p>Sophie Evans (nee Parnell) was the grand auunt of Charles
Stewart Parnell M.P. She also contributed to the building of the
two catholic schools in the parish. To this day, each year a small
amount of money (£20) is given towards the cleaning of the schools
from the Sophie Evans Trust fund. She died in Paris but her remains
were brought back to Portrane and she is buried alongside her
husband at St Catherine's Cemetery Portrane.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The cache is a small container covered in black cloth<br />
Please replace it with care to prevent muggles from finding it.</p>
<p>There is no access to the cache from the Portrane/Donabate
costal path</p>

Shame about the surrounding buildings which as jme1979 noted were quite run down. We entered via another path and soon found the likely location. Of course that's where it'll be but after searching no, it's not there - no way! Another search soon had the cache in hand. On exiting we finally saw the private property sign so we moved quickly!</li></ul></logs>
