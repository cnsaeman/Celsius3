  <long-description><center><b>Tragedy:</b></center>
<p align="justify">The Stardust fire is one of the worst fires
Dublin and Ireland has ever seen in modern times.<br />
At 01:41 a.m. on Valentine's Day 1981 in the Stardust Nightclub in
Artane (Butterly Business Park, Kilmore Road), while the club was
full of people (about 841), inside the building the fire was
noticed. It was claimed to have been started by a slashed seat
cover allowing a flame to ignite the foam beneath, paper
decorations for the Valentine's Night celebrations, causing the
entire building to catch fire. In this tragedy 48 people died and
214 were injured.<br />
<br />
Because some of the main fire exits turned out to be locked with
padlocks and chains, people tried to escape through the men's
toilets but the windows there had metal plates fixed on the inside
and iron bars on the outside. Seven people died in the toilets
while the fire services attempted to rescue them.<br />
<br />
It is believed that the fire was caused by arson, what has never
been proven.</p>

Final cache is hidden close to Butterly Business Park where
Stardust Nightclub was existed. The cache is a small size container
& includes a logbook with space for a couple of small items.
Bring a writing tool<br />
<b>PLEASE</b> rehide well to prevent it being muggled. This area is
popular with children playing and hanging around here. It is
recommended to look for the final on the weekends or in the
evenings after business hours (9-5).</p>

</li><li>2010-05-16T19:00:00Z : Found it by Blue Jay 59 <br />Well this was a bit of a marathon for us [:O]
Partly our own fault because I had a blonde moment at one of the earlier stages gathering the info, and partly because stage 4 was missing when we searched for it a couple of days.
However, all's good and we found the cleverly hidden stage 4 & the final this evening. 
Glad to have this off our list [:D]
Thanks for a great cache to creator and minder.
