  <long-description><p>The name Portmarnock originated from Irish meaning port, and
St.Marnock who arrived there in the fifth century. Marnock a
missionary of St.Patrick, also associated with Kilmarnock in
Scotland, converted the local Celts from worshiping Water, Trees,
and Wells, to Christianity. (Tendencies that are still prevalent
today if you observe the inhabitants fancy gardens!) Being
politically correct Marnock blessed the Druid Well and it became
the Holy Well. The ruins of Marnock's church are still to be seen
in the graveyard</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The Cache is a decon container please take care retrieving and
replacing the cache and beware of the golfing muggles</p>
