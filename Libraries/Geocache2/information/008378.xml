If you read logs carefully you know what is it about. But still had many problems, after Dara told me what is the name of that in English (that was biggest problem for me). But still took me few days for dissloving.
Cache found in few seconds, typical Windsocker's location :D
TFTC!</li><li>2008-10-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by merann <br />Eventually found after a short search as co-ords were jumping about a bit. We found the cache in the place we had first looked but hadn't seen it until we put our heads in. It's really well hidden. SL.
TFTC, Merann. </li><li>2008-03-24T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />My second visit to the location, having failed to find it on a previous occasion 4 months ago. It was early morning, not yet bright, but I was systematic and it didn't take long before I put my hand on the cache. Always nice to get "closure" on a DNF.</li><li>2007-12-28T20:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />Phew! 
I had figured out the code very early on, but it wasn't quite as simple as that of course. I gave up on it then and placed it in my ignore list, but a hint for Dara recently put me back on the right track, and I solved the puzzle on Christmas Eve. 
The hardest part turned out to be actually reading what was on the photo. The characters are (deliberately) very "fuzzy". 
Anyway, the puzzle deciphered, I went on to the cache location today, where there was another surprise, but luckily nothing too tricky. Got to the location, immediately saw the hiding place, but didn't see the cache. 
Searched all around the area, and then went back to the most likely place. Stuck my head in, used my phone as a light, and there it was. Whoever found it last hid it VERY well. </li></ul></logs>
