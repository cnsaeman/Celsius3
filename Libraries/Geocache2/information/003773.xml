  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by Serapis <br />Myself and the good wife were at a wedding in Dunboyne castle a few weeks ago and we decided to go for this. Why did we not find it? Well we forgot it. We were well on the way back to Waterford when I remembered it. How do you forget to find a cache? To much grog the night before, probably. 
Today I found it eventually after wandering around the graveyard avoiding the intense cleanup that was going on. Mary’s grave hasn’t had a trim yet and the strimmer man probably thought I was a bit strange (mad [;)]).
The final co-ords were about 10 m off for me. I had to endure a few muggle infringes, including the a man in a BMX X5 who probably was the occupier of the nearby house, I got a bit of a stare as he waited for his gates to open. My Oregon 400 sometimes doubles up as a handy mobile phone. Had to do a bit of ‘where would I hide it’ sort of thing until it came up trumps. TNLNSL, Serapis.

The first stage was no bother, the trouble with Mary was finding her. Once that had been done the rest was a walk in the ... park.

As she said, you wouldn't want to be looking for Mary in the dark.
Nice final hiding spot.

Found Michael and then found the 3 Mary's. You'd want your glasses on to find the right Mary, wouldn't like to be looking for her in the dark.[:D]
Congrats on your first cache hide. Nice one. Look forward to more.
