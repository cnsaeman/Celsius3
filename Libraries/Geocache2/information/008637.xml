  <long-description><p>Shaw's Woods lie in the area now known as Bushy Park -
originally part of a large estate owned by the Shaw family. There
is plenty of parking in the area, and the buses serving the park
are 15B, 16, 16A and 47.</p>
<p>The coordinates given are for a feature in the park - to find
the cache, you will need to gather a small amount of information
:</p>
<p>At these coordinates, how many pillars support the front of the
structure (A)</p>
<p>How many steps up to the structure? (B)</p>
<p>How many park benches are there placed around the nearby duck
pond(C)?</p>
<p>Construct the cache coordinates as follows :</p>
N 53 18.AB1 ; W006 1(C-A).A(B-A)4<br />

We had done the stages of this multi along time ago but as light was fading when we got to the cache site we decided to leave it to another day to locate the container. Forward-wind probably a year later....We didn't bother using the GPSr, we just started looking around were it had brought us to last time. As we couldn't find anything, we looked at the hint. After a few minutes we realised we had read the hint incorrectly and were consequently looking in the wrong spot [:P] Although muggles were a plenty at this location on such a sunny day we still managed to retrieve the container sign the log and replace unseen.

A gorgeous park and a fairly obvious place. Unfortunately the log is totally soaked through and mouldy so we didn't sign it. Dropped off a TB.</li></ul></logs>
