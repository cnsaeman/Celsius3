  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-05T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Sordini <br />Tried on two separate days...</li><li>2010-03-13T20:00:00Z : Found it by Frezeluberz <br />Oh this cache will not be forgotten.
Looks like the underneath of all the prickly bushes in the area have been vacuum cleaned.
Seriously!
Not only that but it took an hour with help and we were still struggling.
Luckily we had supplies to spur us on ... a very berry muffin.
Sat and ate that hoping it would help - it didn't.
A second phone call for help (to the same person) and we were none the wiser.
When we finally did find the cache it seems we misunderstood the instructions.
We'd been looking in the wrong bush the whole bleeding time.
Our helper returned with further info.
Armed with said info the hunt pace hightened and sure enough the cache was in our hand.
You know ... when we first arrived and read the hint I all but pointed at the cache's location.
If you'd drawn a line from where I pointed to and where the cache was found the difference would have been about 30 or 40cm.
Why oh why we couldn't find it I'll never know.
Including the 15 mins walk ... total time spent on this cache &gt; 1 hour 30 mins.
Had fun all the same.

Before venturing onto the rock I put on Shiro's lead, and kept it short so he wouldn't stray near the edge. I had found this cache in 2007, but the walk was much easier this time because the vegetation wasn't encroaching so much onto the path, and wasn't wet! It's a very interesting walk, thanks!</li><li>2010-02-13T20:00:00Z : Found it by lenik1 <br />A nice spot. TFTC</li><li>2009-11-09T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by didi2206 <br />Found the spot easy but no joy with cache after 30 min search.. holly pretty thick now. Perhaps it's been moved or just badly overgrown?? Too bad, nice path tho.. thanks!</li><li>2009-07-19T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Kersti.com <br />We parked at the suggested coordinates and headed off in search of the cache. Found the old residence along the narrow, muddy and overgrown path (which was surprisingly well kept in some patches) and then found the rock. Evidence of reasonably recent fires and a fair bit of rubbish but no cache to be found. After searching every conceivable nook and cranny we headed back to find that some low-life scum had attempted to raid the car, driver's side window smashed but luckily nothing taken. At the local servo Gareth was a total gem and helped to get us back to a state where we could head off again.</li></ul></logs>
