 Cache Information:<br />
***PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS A DANGEROUS DROP VERY CLOSE TO THE
CACHE SITE SO CHILDREN SHOULD BE VERY CAREFULLY SUPERVISED***<br />
 This is a micro magnetic cache. You will need to bring a pen or
pencil. <br />
The coordinates above should bring you to a canal lock near the
inner city suburb of Phibsboro. To find the final coordinates count
the (mostly green but not all) numbered poles BETWEEN the lock and
the Phibsboro bridge (also green). Call that number "A". <br />
On your way toward the bridge the number on the sixth pole is what?
Call that number "B".<br />
<br />
The final coordinates are N53 21.A67 W006 16.B15<br />
<br />
<br />
In recent years, Phibsboro has experienced a renaissance and house
prices in the area have increased substantially. Moreover, private
developers have secured planning permission to upgrade the existing
Phibsboro Shopping Centre through a €75 million refurbishment. The
area retains much of its original Victorian architecture, including
terraces of red-brick houses and majestic churches, such as St.
Peter's Church, as well as number of traditional Irish pubs such as
O'Mahony's and The Hut. Recently, the government announced plans to
close historic Mountjoy Prison in 2008 and redevelop the site,
maintaining at least some of the original buildings. St Peter's
Church's entrance displays a prominent skull and crossbones motif
on a piece of masonry near the front gate.<br />
<br />
 The Royal Canal separates Phibsboro from Drumcondra, and the
immediately adjacent neighbourhood of Glasnevin. There is a linear
park along the canal, leading to the City Basin (also known as
"Blessington St Basin"), which is a popular walking area for locals
and visitors. This linear park is situated along the former
trajectory of a spur from the Royal Canal.The ¾-mile branch
originally ran south from below the 5th lock on the Royal's main
line, under the North Circular Road by Blacquiere Bridge and along
the east side of Phibsborough Road. Foster Aqueduct carried the
canal over Phibsborough Road to the terminus, a large harbour at
the Broadstone.<br />
<br />
Phibsboro also contains one of the major teaching hospitals of
Dublin, the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, it is also in
close proximity to the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. In early
June 2006 the government announced plans to develop a National
Children's Hospital on a site adjoining the Mater Hospital.<br />
<br />
<br />
 The Royal Canal<br />
The towpath along the canal is now designated “The Royal Canal
Way”. It is possible to walk or cycle from the 1st Dock in the
centre of Dublin to the 40th lock and is being cleared further as
restoration proceeds towards the Shannon and Longford. Signposts
have been erected at each bridge between Clonsilla and Mullingar.
Eventually these will be extended to cover the entire length of the
canal</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by tolmaion <br />What a beautiful and sunny day it was today - perfect for biking over to the Royal Canal and grabbing this cache. At first, I was not sure which poles to count exactly and got the coordinates wrong. It turns out that you should count *only* the green poles, none of the other, wooden ones. Then, the coordinates make sense and the cache is easy to get.
