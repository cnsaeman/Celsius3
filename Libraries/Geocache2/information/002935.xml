  <description>The location of this my first Cache is in Co.Wicklow Ireland. You
can access the Cache from any side (ie 360degree range). It is on a
small mountain that has a road all the way around it so this means
that it is up to you to decided which side is best to attack the
challenge. It is an easy Cache and I have given in a 1.5 for both
Terrain and general difficulty. It is a easy quick cache and you
can drive within .5 of a k of it.
</description>
  <long-description>The Cache is in some loose rocks so mind you don't twist your
ankles. You will have to lift a few rocks to see the cache and
please do put them back. 
<p>The cache is in a Lunch box with a blue lid.</p>
<p>I am not going to reveal the contents, you will have to geocache
to find out what is in it.</p>
