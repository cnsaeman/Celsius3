<center>Factory windows are always broken.<br />
Somebody's always throwing bricks,<br />
Somebody's always heaving cinders,<br />
Playing ugly Yahoo tricks.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>Factory windows are always broken.<br />
Other windows are let alone.<br />
No one throws through the chapel-window<br />
The bitter, snarling, derisive stone.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>Factory windows are always broken.<br />
Something or other is going wrong.<br />
Something is rotten--I think, in Denmark.<br />
End of factory-window song.</center>
