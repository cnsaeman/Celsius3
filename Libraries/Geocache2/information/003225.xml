  <description>This multicache (all stages and the final cache) is located in
Sandycove, near the James Joyce Museum (Martello tower). It is
probably best to attempt finding this cache walking. There are
several transport links to the cache. It can be reached from the
Sandycove DART station and the 7, 46A and 75 busses (bus stop in
Dun Laoghaire). Or you can park your car at N 53° 17.430 W 006°
07.620.</description>

<h4>THE FORTY FOOT</h4>
<p>The Forty Foot is a promontory on the southern tip of Dublin Bay
at Dún Laoghaire where people have swum in the Irish Sea all year
round for some 250 years. It is famous for offering a swimming
point to those who are brave enough to face the chilling
temperature of the Irish Sea.</p>
<p>In former times it was kept solely as a gentlemen's bathing
place and the gentlemen's swimming club was established to help
conserve the area. Things have changed since then, and the place is
now also open to women and children as well. The gentlemen's
swimming club still exists and is open to both genders.</p>
<p>The area may have been called the Forty Foot after the 42nd
Highland Regiment of Foot (now known as the Black Watch), a
regiment of the British Army, which built a fortress here in 1747.
Another theory is that it took its name from the nearest train stop
in the 1800s, which was at Dun Laoghaire (then Kingstown). Just
outside the station, the road leading up to the town was 40ft wide.
Passengers from Dublin coming for a swim said they were alighting
at the "forty foot" and over time the name transferred itself to
the swimming spot, which back then was about 20 feet to the left of
where most swimmers now enter the water.</p>
<p>The Martello Tower is located just a few tens of meters from The
Forty Foot and James Joyce, a writer of international renown,
resided there. The tower now holds a museum (James Joyce Museum),
devoted to the life and works of him. He used the tower setting for
the first chapter of his masterpiece, Ulysses.</p>
<h4>The Cache:</h4>
<p>To find the cache you will need to visit a couple of locations
first.</p>
<p>Stage One: N 53° 17.249 W 006° 06.999. At this stage, you will
see a commemorative stone. Take a date when the tree was planted in
May 1983 and call it AB.</p>
<p>Stage Two: N 53° 17.321 W 006° 06.861. At this location, you
will see a few lifebuoys. How many lifebuoys are there? Call this
C.</p>
<p>Stage Three: N 53° 17.366 W 006° 06.831. At this stage, there is
a few low colored corner stones (not the lithic blockstones!!!).
How many of these stones are there? Call this D.</p>
<p>Stage Four: N 53° 17.321 W 006° 06.811. At this location, you
will see some stairs. How many stairs are leading to the tower?
Call this E.</p>
<p>You now have everything you need to find the cache. Don´t forget
what you have to COUNT FIRST during the counting. Just bethink of
Maths at primary school and you get it. The cache can be found
at:<br />
<b>N53° 17. (31 x B - D)<br /></b> <b>W006° 06. [3 x C] [(A x B) –
(2 x D)] [3 x E + A]<br />
<br /></b></p>
<p>The cache is a small tupperware container with a logbook, a pen,
a sharpener and some stuff for trade.
<font color="orangered"><b>Please take out a cache with extreme
care because it’s muggled area, especially at sunny days. Replace
the cache carefully and EXACTLY as you found it!</b></font></p></long-description>

So just got back out to the 40 Foot to find this little one today. It was lovely out there on a mild and warm St.Patricks day. 
Didn't see any coin.
