  <logs><ul><li>2009-10-11T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by crc_73 <br />My first try for a cache, and it was a bust, couldn't find it. Went down quite a bit from the bottom of the crag, and searched around all the boulders, but nothing. GPS co-ordinates pointed to a position going up around the left-hand side of the crag, but nothing there either. Even took the picture of Stephen_McC with his dog as a reference, think I found the rock he was beside, but no cache around there.

Wet and muddy starting out, and misty too, couldn't see the water in the lower lake, but as soon as I got to the top of the crag it opened up, and the view was spectacular. Followed the ridge around the upper lake back to the parking spot. A nice 2 hour hike, including searching, about 4kms in total. Worth the scramble up to the crag.

Would go back again, but will wait for someone to confirm the cache is still there.</li><li>2009-09-13T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by woodenbuttons <br />searched around but could not find it.  saw a perfect spot that seemed would be perfect for a geocache with a covering liftable stone, but nothing.  maybe its gone? will be interesting to see if someone else finds it next!</li><li>2009-06-29T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by nisse_perlemo <br />Spectacular location, worth a visit any time.
Couldn't find the cache, although I searched for a long time.
Other problems:
Some 20 + goats looked menacingly down at me during the final ascent and I contemplated retreat, but they moved away as I got closer. </li><li>2009-03-23T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by marra-cache <br />Absolutely great place for a cache. Unfortunately I couldn't find it in the end after searching pretty long [:(]
Sometimes I couldn't find the correct path up, especially the last 150m which made it T 4,5 for me. Got pretty wet & dirty shoes but it was worth it!
