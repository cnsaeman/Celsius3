<p>"The Scalp is a deep gash in the hills of County Dublin through
which the R117 Dublin &ndash; Enniskerry road goes. There is only a
miserable little stream in it now, obviously quite incapable of
having carved its way 100 m down through solid granite. It is in
fact a glacial overflow channel , cut at the end of the last Ice
Age when the the melting ice created a great lake of melt water
trapped between the ice in the north and the Dublin Mountains.
Eventually the water rose high enough to top the ridge and the
power of the huge volume of escaping water cut out the Scalp as we
know it."</p>
