  <long-description><p>The cache is not at the listed coordinates to find the cache you
will need to do the following:</p>
<p>You can only find this cache at night by looking for some
luminous trail markers.</p>
<p>Please make sure that you take a set of back up batteries for
both your torch and gps also mark your location in case with your
gps in case you get lost in the woods.</p>
<p>The entrance to the woods is on the main Donabate to Portrane
Road.</p>
<p>To find the starting coordinates you will need to find the A
Shady stroll in the day cache the start coordinates are in the
cache container.</p>
<p>From the given coordinates walk a short distance along the
pathway and holding your torch at eye level look into the woods on
your left your torch beam should light a trail marker which is
about two metres off the ground. This is the starting point for the
cache.</p>
<p>From this point follow the trailmarkers into the woods a single
marker denotes continue straight ahead while a double trailmarker
denotes a turn to either the left or right continue following the
trailmarkers untill you see a cluster of three trail markers this
is where the cache is hidden.<br />
To get back to the main pathway from the cache location look for
the single trail markers they will lead you back to the
pathway.</p>
<p><font color="red">Remember while walking along the route take
care of your footing as there are a lot of tree branches on the
ground also at one point you will need to walk down a small steep
incline hence the high terrain difficulty.<br />
Please be careful of your footing in the dark, and don't forget the
back-up batteries.</font></p>
<p>Hope your not afraid of the dark.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The Cache is an ammo box when placed it had a disposable camera
with flash I'll add the photos to the cache page when the camera is
full.<br />
Please take care and rehide the cache to prevent muggles from
discovering its location.</p>

Congrats to the owner. The youngest geocachers we off like a hare out of the trap on this one. Lahtac and Navajo jnr. were blazing a trail with Night Hawk in hot pursuit. BlueJay 59 and Toffee Man were keeping an eye on the leaders to make sure thay dident get swallowed up by an "Alice in Wonderland" type hole. Me and Navajo kept up the rear to cover our tracks.
