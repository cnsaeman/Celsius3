  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-04T19:00:00Z : Found it by Antefix <br />Of course we never heard of Surgalstown before... being Swiss [:D] Thanks for the cache.</li><li>2010-05-25T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Serapis <br />This was frustrating – what I thought should be a quick find along the road was foiled by a car parked at the exact place. Cachers I thought, as there no reason why people would pull in here, the clearance off the road is not that good. But closer inspection revealed a old man asleep and his female partner reading the paper. What a place to stop. I went off for ‘a good walk’ and came back and they were still there. I’ll be back.
