The Dublin magazine fort was built in 1735. The fort can be found in the west of Dublin city, north of the River Liffey within Phoenix Park. The building is located in the south-eastern part of the park, close by a wooded ridge. It has a commanding view of the surrounding area. During the British occupation of the area, the Fort had been seen as a symbol of that occupation but by 1939 its purpose was to house the Irish Army's stocks of guns and ammunition.

Details of the Christmas Raid here in 1939 can be found at Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Raid

Anyway, back to the log - found with Cam and Toadster.
