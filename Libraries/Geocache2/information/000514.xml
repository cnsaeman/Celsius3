  <long-description><p>SOME HISTORY AND FACTS:<br />
Cadburys was started in the UK in 1824 by John Cadbury and in 1847
he took on his brother Benjamin as a partner.</p>
<p>In 1905/1906 Cadbury Brothers introduced a new recipe for milk
chocolate, marketed under the name Cadbury Dairy Milk, which has
remained a mainstay of its product line ever since.</p>
<p>The actual inventor of eating chocolate is unknown. However in
1847, Fry & Sons of Bristol, who eventually merged with Cadbury
limited in 1919, sold a ‘chocolate delicieux a manger’. Many people
credit this as the first chocolate bar. John Cadbury produced his
first bar in 1849 and went on to produce fruit flavoured centres
covered with chocolate – the first chocolate assortments.</p>
<p>Milk Chocolate:<br />
Up to this point in history only dark chocolate had been made, but
in 1875 a Swiss manufacturer, Danial Peters of Vevey, produced the
first milk chocolate bar using powdered milk. The Cadbury brothers
followed suit and monitored Vevey’s progress as he eventually
mastered producing a product using condensed milk. The public loved
it and milk chocolate began to dominate the market. Cadburys
currently uses 227,000 litres of milk a day in Ireland producing
milk choclate.</p></long-description>
