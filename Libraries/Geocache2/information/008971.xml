  <long-description><p><b>Luke Ryan</b></p>
<p>Luke Ryan was born in Rush in 1750. At an early age he
Immigrated to France and obtained a commission as a lieutenant in
Dillon’s Irish Regiment. After some time he returned to Rush and
Began operating as a smuggler between Ireland and France. Between
1775 and 1783 France sympathized with the Americans during the War
Of Independence, and the French government commissioned Ryan as the
Commander of a privateer, The Black Prince. For several years he
Plundered English ships around the English coast. Unfortunately,
His nest egg, some £70,000 which he had amassed from smuggling and
Privateering, was appropriated by French bankers.<br />
Early in 1782 English forces captured Ryan aboard the Cologne. A
Short time later, on 30th. Of March, he was convicted in the Old
Bailey in London on charges of piracy, smuggling and treason, and
Condemned to death. Ryan led a charmed life, however. Ordered to
The gallows four times, four times he was reprieved. At the
Conclusion of the war, the French intervened on his behalf and
Secured his release.<br />
In stark contrast to his colorful and exciting younger days, Luke
Ryan died in the King’s Bench debtors Prison in 1789, where he Had
been detained for a debt of £200.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2009-05-29T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />Phew! Finally did it.
I can't remember when I started this, it was well over a year ago. 
Every time I was around Rush I would have a go at whatever stage I was at, and eventually I made it through them all. 
Stage 3 had me stumped for a long time - as everyone else has said it's not an easy one. 
Stage 5 also took a few visits, and it's not quite as accessible as it was at one stage. 
It felt nice having the final cache in my hands finally. Everything is in very good condition considering it's been lying there a year. </li><li>2008-07-19T19:00:00Z : Write note by snoopyandmickey <br />part completed.  I ran out of time.  Hope to get back next week or the week after.  Phew!  </li><li>2008-06-14T19:00:00Z : Found it by toczygroszek <br />Congratulations Dara! I was here about 6 pm, only 1 hour later! Sand clock inside was still running :) I thought you took token, but it wasn't here, hmmm...
At stage 3 I spent nearly 6 hours!!! Two dogs helped me - we three together on 4 legs were running in bushes. I didn't know dogs names, but I called them Rush & Lusk [:D] Why it was so long? I was searching in wrong place! I took wrong numbers from stage 2 - life is hard and full of... thorns.
Anyway - final cache is done, but it took me all day. Thanks Mr Windsocker for this experience.

It took weeks, 5 visits to the area, and hours of searching, but my obsessive determination was rewarded with a find at 5 p.m. this afternoon after a short walk and a brief search. 

Unfortunately, the TB "Jagged Metal Token" is not in the cache.</li><li>2008-06-10T19:00:00Z : Write note by daraconn <br />Nearly there - on my third visit to stage 5 I was finally able to get the co-ordinates for the final stage.</li></ul></logs>
