 This cache is one of a series of caches located in St. Anne's Park
in north Dublin. The park, straddling the suburbs of Clontarf and
Raheny, covers 305 acres, and provides a wide range of facilities,
including football pitches, tennis courts, a golf course, chilren's
play area, boules courts and model car track. There's even a
farmer's market in the "red stables" area of the park every
Saturday. The main avenue, woodland paths, arboretum, rose garden
and walled garden all provide ideal locations for peaceful walks.
<br />
<br />
The lands for the park were originally acquired by the Guinness
family in the 1830s. Over the next century the lands were developed
into a magnificent estate before being acquired by Dublin
corporation in 1930. While a portion of the estate was transformed
into a moden housing estate, thankfully most was retained as a
public park. For a more detailed history of the park, please read
Joan Ussher Sharkey's "St Anne's - The Story of a Guinness Estate"
(Woodfield Press, 2002). <br />
<br />
Admission to the park is free. Parking can be found at Sybil Hill
Road, James Larkin Road and Mount Prospect Avenue. While the park
is generally a very pleasant place, it's probably best to visit the
park during daylight hours and to make sure you leave no valuables
on display in your car. <br />
<br />
This cache is located at a tower within the woodland area of the
park. The tower overlooks the quaint duckpond and sad, neglected
waterfront folly. While the tower and the pond must have been a
beautiful sight back in their heyday, unfortunately today they are
located in an area of the park that is not as well maintained as
other areas. Hence graffiti, litter and broken glass are strew
around the general area. This should not spoil your visit to the
location and your hunt for the cache, but it is nonetheless wise to
tread carefully while hunting! After you have found the cache, pop
down to the pond and feed the hungry ducks. You can even peer out
onto the seafront and Bull Island beyond. <br />
<br />
The cache is a tablock box.</long-description>
