  <description>Dublin&rsquo;s Phoenix Park is a treasure with more than 1700 acres
of walled parkland just 3km from the centre of the city.
<p>At 707 hectares (1752 acres) is one of the largest enclosed
recreational spaces within any European capital city.<br /></p></description>

<p>There are some thirty-eight lodges with living accommodation
situated within Phoenix Park and no two dwellings are of the same
design.</p>

The wall is itself designated as a protected structure and
stretches the entire way around the present-day park. It is eleven
kilometres long and three metres high. The wall also supports its
own particular flora. The park is open all year round, there is no
admission charge and visitors can explore freely. Bus Route(s):
No's 10, 25, 37, 38, 39, 66, 67 from city centre. Each of the
vehicular gates into Phoenix Park has a gatekeeper&rsquo;s lodge as
part of the entrance cluster.
<p>Ashtown Castle nearby is worth a visit.</p>

TFTC!</li><li>2010-06-06T19:00:00Z : Found it by poohbear50 <br />After a great night at the West Life Concert the previous night I was still on a high until I drew back the curtains and was met with a really wet miserable Sunday morning. Discussed with WR what our options were and we decided geocaching was best one. WR suggested this series and it sounded good to me.We started th the Park entranc and finished at Ashdown.

With Bloom being in progress in the Park we encountered closed roads and detours but in true geocaching spirit we did not falter in our quest but found other routes or else we walked . On one particular occasion the Garda were very kind to us and let us park on a closed road in order for us to get the cache.

We saw parts of the Park that we probably would never have seen thanks to this series. We saw the deer and the young fawns Thanks for a very enjoyable series.</li><li>2010-06-06T19:00:00Z : Found it by Wild Rover <br />We awoke to a dull dreary and very wet Sunday with little sign that it would improve later. In town for the Westlife concert the previous evening choices were 1. shopping! 2. museums etc or 3. geocaching in the rain. Neither 1 or 2 appealed and rather than head for home we had a look at this series over a coffee. We decided that it was ideal for a rainy day and set forth starting at the main gates and finishing at Ashdown. Co-ords were excellent at all locations including the multis and, with the exception of 1 cache, were relatively easy to locate either from the co-ords or the clue. The one which gave us difficulty yielded only when we applied the "one last look" technique!!!

We also had to contend with some of the roads/gates being closed with the Blooms 2010 event in progress but we either took alternative routes or walked from outside to GZ. In one case we had a closed road and the Garda asked us to move on when we parked (beside their unmarked car!). Once we explained that we just wanted to go "over there" for a few minutes as part of a treasure hunt they could not have been more helpful!!!!! They even checked when we came back that we had had a success!

Really enjoyed the series which took us to parts of the park we had never been in before and gave us the opportunity to see the deer as well. Great series and thanks for bringing us here. TFTC</li><li>2010-06-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by rooske <br />Our fifth of the evening</li></ul></logs>
