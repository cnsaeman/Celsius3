  <long-description><p><b>Ardgillan Demise</b></p>
<p>In 1658 the Down Survey indicates that Ardgillan was owned by
wine merchant Robert Usher of Crumlin, Dublin and by 1737, the
property had been acquired by the Reverend Robert Taylor, one of
the Headfort Taylors, whose grandfather had collaborated with Sir
William Petty on the mid 17th Century "Down Survey of Ireland".
Ardgillan remained the family home of the Taylors (later changed to
Taylour) for more two hundred years until 1962 when the estate was
sold to Heinrick Pott of Westphalia, Germany. In 1982 Dublin County
Council purchased Ardgillan Demesne and it is now managed by Fingal
Council.</p>
<p>The residence at Ardgillan is a large country-style house with
castellated embellishments. Originally named "Prospect", the
central section was built in 1738 by Robert Taylor, with the west
and east wings added in the late 1700's.<br />
Initially the site was heavily wooded, the name Ardgillan being
derived from the Irish "Ard Choill" meaning High Wood. It was
cleared by out-of-service soldiers and itinerant workers in return
for one penny a day, sleeping accommodation and one meal.<br />
As part of an agreement to allow the Dublin to Belfast railway line
to be constructed on the eastern boundry a clause was inserted to
wit Robert Taylor could stop and board the trains at anytime he
choose.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>This cache cannot be access from the roadway you must enter
either the main estate entrance or the "Ladies Stairs"
entrance.</p>
<p>The Cache is a decon box.<br />
Please take care and rehide the cache to prevent muggles from
discovering its location.</p>
