 Cache Information:<br />
<br />
It can be quite muddy along the towpaths outside of the summer
months and sometimes during them also!<br />
<br />
 A. Find the number of the lock at above coordinates.<br />
<br />
B. How many steps rise to the road at coordinates N53 22.908 W006
22.207<br />
<br />
Coordinates for the cache are N53 22.(70 x A + 28) W006 22.(23 x B
+ 35)<br />

The Royal Canal Way<br />
This cache is part of a series placed along the Royal Canal Way.
The series follows the towpaths along the Royal Canal heading
westwards towards the Shannon River. There are a number of caches
in the Dublin region stretching from the city centre out into the
country. Except for the first two centre city caches all of the
waypoints for these caches take you in the direction against the
water flow. To get the full benefit of this series I would suggest
that it is best done on foot or on a bicycle though most of the
caches may also be accessed by car. I have to say that the car
option will take considerable time, petrol and nausea inducing
traffic frustration not to mention considerable difficulty with
parking.</long-description>
