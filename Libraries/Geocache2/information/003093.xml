 THE COORDINATES ABOVE ARE JUST FOR GENERAL GUIDANCE, THEY WILL NOT
LEAD TO THE CACHE. THIS IS A PRETTY DIFFICULT CACHE TO DECIPHER AND
THEN FIND.<br>
VISITORS AND DISTANCE CACHERS **BE WARNED!** IN CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES THIS CACHE CAN BE FOUND IN ONE VISIT. UNLESS YOU COME
PREPARED, AND PERHAPS EQUIPPED, IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE MORE THAN ONE
VISIT.<br>
TO START YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK OUT THE "PUZZLE" IN THE IMAGE
ABOVE.<br>
The cache is a decontamination box with one or two nice things for
an FTF to choose. <br>
The Phoenix Park is a great Dublin amenity but it can become pretty
muddy in winter so be prepared for that (stout shoes or boots
etc..) Speaking of winter, it is probably best to attempt this
cache at that time due to the lack of tree cover. Finding the cache
can be done any time of year but I imagine a little more difficult
in the summer.<br>
Die hards might like to try this without the hints below of which
there are several!</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2009-08-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Finally found it yesterday with Kavdublin.

Kind of sad to see this one go! It got me through many a quiet day in work trying to figure it out. 

Many thanks to Kili or Bust for this one and we look forward to the next one.

</li><li>2009-08-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by kavdublin <br />great cache, hard and did take time,and the hepl of others but well done! looking forward to more of kili or bust caches's. cheers. </li><li>2009-03-29T19:00:00Z : Found it by xenotime <br />my lucky day! great cache and great fun. So much easier without the vegetation. TFTC :-)))</li><li>2009-03-05T20:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />Finally got it!
I played around with the first part for quite a while, and then with a little hint managed to locate it. 
The next part took 5 separate visits. After the owner replaced it (it was indeed gone) it was easy peasy to finish off the cache. 
This is one of the cache I've spent most time on and it was very satisfying to finally have it in my hands. Thanks for the (mostly) fun experience, now please no more!</li><li>2009-03-04T20:00:00Z : Owner Maintenance by Kili or bust <br />Apologies to Fjon who has been searching diligently for this one for a while. I checked today and one stage was indeed missing. Replaced now so should be good to go!</li></ul></logs>
