  <description>This cache should take no more than an hour and most of it can be
done from the car. There are 9 stages in total including the final

<p>Roundwood nestles among the hills of County Wicklow on a plateau
which is 238 metres above sea level. The village is surrounded by
lakes and hills including Vartry Lakes which can be seen from the
Main Street and the spectacular Lough Dan which is just a few miles
away.</p>
<p>The village is also known by its Gaelic name, ‘An Tochar’, which
is based on the Gaelic word ‘Tochar’, meaning a causeway or a
‘level place’. It first came into being because local people built
a causeway of stones and trees which enabled travellers to cross a
wet patch of land.</p>
<p>People have lived in this area for many centuries, but the
village grew mainly since the late 18th. Century. It was a center
of much activity during the Rebellion of 1798 when a local leader
General Joseph Holt of the United Irishmen, conducted a successful
campaign against the British Army. A memorial in his honour was
erected near the village in 1998 by the Roundwood Historical and
Folklore Society.</p>
<p>Roundwood has a close association with two former Presidents of
Ireland, Sean T. O’Kelly who lived locally and Erskine Childers who
is buried in Derralossary Churchyard near the village.</p>
Now, to find the final cache you must complete the following
stages. At each stage you will be able to obtain information which
will either be required to get you to the next stage or you will
need to make a note of a number to help you locate the final cache
hiding spot. 
<p>1. Go to the location above. You will find an unusual piece of
art by Doug Ross. It was erected in 19A8. Make a note of this
decade as you will need the answer for the final cache. In order to
find the coordinates for the next stage you need to obtain the
following information: The title of the piece has how many letters?
Call this answer a and go to N53º 04.110 W006º 12.a65</p>
<p>2. At this location you will see a sign post. A famous film was
made around this area. How many letters are in the title of the
film? Call this answer b and input it into the following
coordinates in order to be able to move forward to the next stage:
N53º 03.(b-5)16 W006º 11.166</p>
<p>3. You are now in a location where you need to search for a
three digit number hidden by us. Once you find these numbers call
them xyz. Solve the following sum: x + y – z = c and fill in the
following space in these coordinates so that you can find the next
stage: N53º 03.191 W006º 11.17c</p>
<p>4. Half way around you are now just outside a building. How many
windows are on the front of the building? = p How many doors are on
the front of the building? = q. Simply solve the following sum to
get a double digit number: (p + q) x 2 = d and go to N53º 03.d5
W006º 11.368</p>
<p>5. You need to note down the number of men at this location
wearing red jackets? Subtract 4 from this number and call your
answer B and make a note of it as you will need it for the final
cache location. Now carry on to the following location: N53º 03.340
W006º 13.042.</p>
<p>6. At this location you will see a four letter description of a
specific business that runs from here. Using the form a=1, b=2, c=3
and so on you should come up with four numbers and call them h, i,
j, k (eg if the business was a “office” the o=15, f=6, f=6, i=9,
c=3, e=5). Add together h + i + j + k = e. Then add this two digit
number to 463 to get the final three digits in the W coordinate
below: N53º 03.779 W006º 13.???</p>
<p>7. You now find yourself outside a pub in the heart of the
village. Either call in for a pint of the black stuff or make a
note of the phone number hanging on the sign outside, 01 281?247.
Call this answer C. You will need this for the final cache
location.</p>
<p>8. Almost there! Go to N53º 03.950 W006º 13.457. You should see
a two digit yellow number. Take the second digit and call it D. You
can now input the final cache location numbers A,B,C & D
collected on your trip around the reservoir to find the final cache
and it’s goodies!</p>

Log: 14:20</li><li>2010-05-16T19:00:00Z : Found it by rashers <br />Used to live in the house between points 4 and 5, so thoroughly enjoyed the cycle.  It took about 1.5 hrs by bike, but I was in no rush.  Walking it (with kids) might take about 2.5 hrs at leisure.  By the way, on point 8, there's only one digit, as the other one has fallen off - thankfully, the correct one is still there.[:D]  In: TB</li><li>2010-01-30T20:00:00Z : Found it by JRM-IRL <br />Caching in the area whilst attending the New Years Resolution Event, so we thought we'd take a spin around Roundwood before we hit the pub for lunch!

The multi- part of the cache was easy....the final part was not so easy, as the batteries in the Etrex died 20 feet away....so found via instinct rather than technology!

Sad to say, the weather has not been kind to the object at Stage 1, and it is looking very sorry for itself.

The log is a little damp, still able to be written on though.

Our final walk was about four times longer than necessary -- thanks to a mis-keyed coordinate.  (We can't tell our big Bs from our little bs...)  We did enjoy the extra walk :-)</li><li>2008-08-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by fortytwo_monkeys <br />Really really enjoyed this. Only our second one. Couldn't find and finally guessed stage 3 but the great clues reassured us we were back on track. Final location is lovely. TNLNSL. TFTC.</li></ul></logs>
