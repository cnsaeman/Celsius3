<br />
***CURRENTLY IRELAND'S MOST VISITED PHYSICAL CACHE*** <br />
<br />
Historic Dublin Castle features the 18th century State Apartments,
the Undercroft with its unique 10th century Viking defence bank, a
restaurant, craft shop and ancient Chapel which are open to the
public.<br />
<br />
It was from Dublin Castle that Red Hugh O’Donnell escaped in 1591
with Art (O’Neill) and they undertook a gruelling winter journey
into the Wicklow mountains on foot. While awaiting help from
friendly forces, Art who had been injured in the jump from the
castle wall died in the frozen mountain conditions. (Arts Cache,
GCP0GB, is placed at a commemorative Cross erected in honour of his
struggle). <br />
Hugh suffered frostbite and lost 2 of his toes but was saved when
help arrived. He went back to his native Donegal and became one of
Ireland’s most colourful and influential figures in Ireland's long
struggle against crown forces.<br />
<br />
There are ancient tunnels under the city which can be traced back
to the major sites like this one. It is rumoured that there is even
a wide passageway which travels from Dublin Castle all the way to
the centre of the Phoenix Park which is several miles west of here.
It is interesting to note the "official" silence on such matters
when discussion takes place about creating an underground Metro
system for a city that has badly needed one for the last 30 years.
<br />
<br />
 Chester Beatty Library<br />
<br />
Sir Alfred Chester Beatty: American mining engineer, financier,
philanthropist and collector, bequeathed his unique and amazing
collection for the benefit of the public. He retired to Ireland in
1950 and spent much time in Dublin until his death in 1968. The
library became a public charitable trust in 1969.<br />
The Library opens a window on the artistic treasures of the great
cultures and religions of the world. It’s collection of
manuscripts, prints, icons, miniature paintings, early printed
books and object d’art from countries across Asia, the Middle East,
North Africa and Europe offers visitors a visual feast—all the
result of the collecting activities of one man.<br />
Egyptian papyrus texts, beautiful illuminated copies of the Qur’an,
the Bible, European medieval and renaissance manuscripts are among
the highlights of the collection. Turkish and Persian miniatures
and striking Buddhist paintings are also on display, as are Chinese
dragon robes and Japanese woodblock prints. In its diversity, the
collection captures much of the richness of human creative
expression from about 2700BC to the present day.<br />
The main exhibition galleries are situated in a modern addition to
the Clock Tower Building at Dublin Castle, to which the Library
moved in November 1999.<br />
 Opening times: Jan-Dec. 10.00-16.45 Mon-Fri and 14.00-16.45 Sat,
Sun and Bank Hols.<br />

Thanks for showing this nice garden and the Cache, eve</li><li>2005-10-01T07:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />I had put off seeing the Chester Beatty - figured I'd do that later, but in the true spirit of geocaching, I decided to visit a spot I wouldn't normally have done and I was suitably rewarded for my trouble. I know this may be sacrilege, but I thought that Chester's collection gave better examples of illumination than the Book of Kells. If you're looking for illuminated manuscripts, then you MUST see this collection.

Oh, but that's right. I'm here for the cache log! Only took a few seconds. As soon as I saw the area I figued out the name's meaning and had the cache in hand in no time at all. Surprising few people around for a Saturday - guess it's the lovely Dublin weather! TNLNSL</li></ul></logs>
