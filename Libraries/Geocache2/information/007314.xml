  <long-description><p><b>Clontarf Promenade</b></p>
<p>Stretching for about 3 kilometres from Fairview Park to the Bull
Wall at Dollymount, the Promenade is 40 metres wide and is about
26.5 hectares in extent. Reclaimed from the sea in the 1920s and
finally completed and landscaped in the late 1950s, this much
admired amenity is a popular location for a bracing seaside walk
with every possibiltiy in the winter or spring of encountering
flocks of grazing Brent geese.</p>
<p>At the Clontarf end of the Promenade, near the Dart line is the
Children's Traffic School, constructed in 1971 and adjoining it is
a well used floodlit all-weather facility for athletics and
football. The prominent "Sails" sculpture was added in 1988; the
dedicated cycle track in 1997; the memorial seat to Alfie Byrne,
former Lord Mayor of Dublin, in 1999; and the 'Maoi' Sculpture near
Vernon Avenue in 2004.</p>
<p>Clontarf promenade isn't exactly Venice Muscle Beach, the famous
stretch in LA, nevertheless, last November several pieces of
exercise equipment were installed along the length of the promenade
turning it into a free gym.</p>
<p>There is a cross-trainer, a pulldown trainer, a rider, some
parallel bars, a shoulder joint exerciser, a Tai Chi pushing
apparatus, and a massager.</p>
<p>The pieces were commissioned by Dublin City Council and have
been supplied by a Clontarf-based company called DynamX.</p>

<p>Enjoy exercising with the equipment along the promenade, or
enjoy The Massager after a long days caching : )</p>
<p><b>Please</b> be watchful for muggles, of which there will be
plenty!</p></long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Wow, a massager! That's what we were needing. Yes, because geocaching is a tiring activity [:D].
Lot's of people enjoying the promenade, running or walking.

Thanks for this one...
