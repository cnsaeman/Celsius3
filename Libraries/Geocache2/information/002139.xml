  <long-description><p><b>Jack the Bachelor</b></p>
<p>Jack the Bachelor and Jack Field are names for a smuggler called
Jack Connor, who lived in Rush. Connor was a native of Wexford. who
practiced his trade from the Smugglers Cave between Loughshinney
and Skerries, Connor was a romantic and swashbuckling character,
and was very popular in high society circles. One 18th. Century
ballad mentions him in a particularly rich-worded verse:</p>
<p>"The lover may sigh</p>
<p>the courtier may lie</p>
<p>And Croesus his treasure amass,</p>
<p>all these joys are but vain they are blended with pain</p>
<p>I'll stand behind Field and my glass"</p>
<p>A number of stories circulate about Jack's cave, most claiming
it holds treasure. One rather far-fetched version has a huge green
serpent guarding the treasure. Another has two men going in search
of the riches, never to be seen again. Presumably the serpent got
them. Others say that the cave extends as far as Baldongan Castle.
"Jack the Bachelor" is buried in Kenure graveyard.</p>
<p><b>The Smugglers Cave</b></p>
<p>The Cliff path to the smugglers cave (a mine outlet) which is
reputed to have been used by smugglers to store their goods during
the late 18th century, has all but disappeared due to coastal
erosion but it is still possible to go by the seashore at low tide
with a local guide.</p>
<p>The smuggling trade became very lucrative in the
Rush/Loughshinny area after the British Government imposed excise
duties on a large number of goods. In 1765 the use of the Isle of
Man as a centre for warehousing ceased as the British took
possession of the island and so about fifty large vessels in the
area of Rush became involved in the smuggling trade.</p>
<br />
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p><b>Before you can start this cache you will need to complete
<a href='http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c2e387ff-2511-4109-86f1-3df38ac72603'
   target="_blank">"Woar War"</a> for some relevant
   information.</b></p>
<br />
<p><b>WARNING!</b></p>
<p>You need to check local tide times for parts of this cache.
Access to the coast is only available at Loughshinny or Skerries.
Please do not attempt to access the coast from the road between
these two places as you would have to cross private land and there
would also be some dangerous scrambling involved.</p>
<p>I STRONGLY advise that you commence this cache at part one at
least two hours before low tide and this assumes that you have the
necessary codes from "WOAR WAR" already.</p>
<p>You can check local tide times
<a href='http://easytide.ukho.gov.uk/easytide/easytide/SelectPrediction.aspx?PortID=0622'
   target="_blank">Here</a></p>
<p>Walking boots are a must and you may need wellies as well.</p>
<p>This is not a cache for children as coastal errosion has created
some areas of difficulty and danger. Please be extremely careful
while scrambling on any seaweed covered rocks.</p>
<br />
<p><b>Part one</b></p>
<p>At the above coordinates you will find the grave of Jack“The
Bachelor”Connor. Nearby you will find some coordinates for part two
of this cache.</p>
<p><b>Part Two</b></p>
<p>You will find more coordinates here after which you will need to
go to Jacks hiding place listed on a stone slab nearby.</p>
<p><b>Part Three</b></p>
<p>Here you will find a number of letters etched by Jack
abbreviating his favorite cat. The coordinates for the final cache
will be made up as follows:</p>
<p>Take the number of letters first and place it at “A” below.
Convert the first letter to a number as per ABC=123 and place it at
B below. Using the same system add the first and second letters
together and place the answer at C below.</p>
<p><b>Part four</b></p>
<p><b>The final coordinates for the cache are N53 A2.96C W006

Kidding.  Seriously tho a great cache on reflection.  Got stuck at stage 2 so went back to the start and systematically went though it again. 5 star terrain was very appropriate in this weather.
