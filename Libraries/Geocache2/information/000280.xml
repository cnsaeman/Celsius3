This cache is one in a series highlighting some of Dublin's finest
examples of Art Deco architecture. The design movement, which was
popular roughly between the two world wars, never had an enormous
impact in Ireland. Nevertheless many beautiful buildings were
constructed along Art Deco lines, and while many have been
demolished, there are still several fine examples to be seen in
modern Dublin. This series of caches will bring you to several
examples, but is not intended to be a comprehensive list. <br />
<br />
The structure of Art Deco is based on mathematical geometric
shapes. It was widely considered to be an eclectic form of elegant
and stylish modernism, being influenced by a variety of sources.
Among them were the so-called "primitive" arts of Africa, Ancient
Egypt, and Aztec Mexico, as well as machine-age or streamline
technology such as modern aviation, electric lighting, the radio,
the ocean liner and the skyscraper. <br />
<br />
Art Deco design influences were expressed in fractionated,
crystalline, faceted forms of decorative Cubism and Futurism. Other
popular themes in Art Deco were trapezoidal, zigzagged, geometric,
and jumbled shapes, which can be seen in many early pieces. These
were the buildings of the future: sleek, geometric, dramatic. With
their cubic forms and zigzag designs, art deco buildings embraced
the machine age. <br />
<br />
This building, at the top of Grafton Street, once housed Nobletts
Sweet shop. It was built at some point in the 1930s and, despite
its distinctive tower, is often overlooked by the throngs that pass
by it every day. Today it houses a newsagents shop.<br />
<br />
 This cache is a nano. It is placed away from the building itself,
in a marginally quiter location! Stealth is required in this urban
location, and please be aware of the many people who pass by this
busy spot. You may have to find this cache by touch, rather than by
sight! <br />
