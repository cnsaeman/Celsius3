  <long-description><p align="justify">The coast on Sandymount Strand is an interesting
combination of industrial buildings and wild nature. Low tide
uncovers about 2 km of sandy bottom and green algae. A large inlet
of water that remains even at low tide is known locally as "Cockle
Lake". The place, which in 1970's was a construction material dump,
is now known as Irishtown Nature Park (N53 20.145 W006 12.018).
Grass, shrubs and small trees grow in there and it is a good place
for many animals, in particular birds. For that reason dogs must be
kept on a leash. In winter Sandymount Strand is a resting place for
Brent geese that arrive here from Arctic Canada. You can spot them
between October and April, especially in Sean Moore park, where
they feed on grass. The plants, whose seeds drifted here or came on
ships via the port, make a unique composition of flora.<br />
<br />
 The cache is hidden between Sean Moore park and Irishtown Nature
Park. You can get there by a footpath. If you drive, I think the
best parking space is the road close to Sean Moore park at N53
20.074 W 006 12.819. It isn't a very busy place, but popular for
walking. Watch for Muggles!</p>
<p>Please note that at the moment there is no pencil in the cache
box, so bring your own!</p>
