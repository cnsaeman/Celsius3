  <long-description><p>One of a series of caches along the Dodder River – the paths
linking these caches are wheelchair and buggy/pram passable, unless
otherwise stated. All the caches in this series are also accessible
to the wheelchair user, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>This one is a micro-cache, hidden in a small park next to the
car-park at N53 18.476 W 006 15.338 and is accessible by, and from,
wheelchair. You might take the time to have a look in the river at
the back of the pub – there are a couple of wildlife sculptures to
be seen! Given the Dublin custom of naming statues/monuments
somewhat irreverently, this one escaped lightly, being christened
Ryan O’Neal!!</p>
<p>This cache can easily be done in conjunction with “Dodder –
Dartry Park” and “Dodder – St Annes”</p>
