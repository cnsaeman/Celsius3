  <long-description><p>For centuries Kenure House and its woodland dominated the
skyline and the life of Rush. Not that the inhabitants of Rush were
ever fully dominated by any great landowners, whoever they might
be. Having made their living for centuries from the sea and from
the fertile land of the region, their relationship with their great
landowners was a respectfully independent one. As far back as the
early 16th Century, the fishermen of Rush exhorted the owners of
Kenure to secure a safe harbor for their boats, saying that
otherwise they would have to seek employment elsewhere and "no
longer dwell in this habitation".</p>
<p>The tragedy of the demise of Kenure House is that the house,
walled gardens and woodland, were equal, if not superior, in
architecture, natural beauty and history, to other estates in the
Fingal area, estates like Ardgillan or New bridge House, which have
since been acquired as public amenities. The sale of Kenure House
by the Palmer family came that few years too early for such
enlightened planning.</p>
<p>All that remains of the park today are the main gates and a
small woodland leading into a housing estate.</p>
