  <long-description><p>The stages in this multi-cache are all related to the "Grand"
theme - as a landmark for those achieving their 1000th cache.</p>
<p>The coordinates at the top of the page will get you to the first
stage, which contains the coords for the second stage. The second
stage wil give the coords for the final cache.</p>
<p>This is an easy cache, but there's a bit of mileage involved! On
a normal weekend day, it should take less than 3 hours to
complete</p></long-description>
  <encoded-hints>Stage 1 : Old gate - 2nd from left.
Stage 2 : Could there be a sign round about here?
Stage 3 : Now where else would you expect it to be??</encoded-hints>
