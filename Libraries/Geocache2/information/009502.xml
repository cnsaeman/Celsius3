<center>An old Cemetery of the minute town of "Milverton"</center></description>
  <long-description><p>Most of the locals (except those that live right next to it)
don't even know about this cemetery, which neverthelesss still
appears in use. Some of the graves are really old, although it is
hard to tell how old exactly as their prints have become
unreadable. This cemetery is in a nice location, and the cache can
easily be combined with

Looks like someone started to re-build the Church at one stage (Damp proof put in) and then just stopped ..... Must have run out with the Celtic Tiger [:)]
