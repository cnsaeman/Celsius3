  <long-description>Visiting Naas from the Ruhrgebiet in faraway Germany we decided
this charming place deserved its first own cache. The cache is a
drive in and located between Tandy's bridge and Osberstown bridge,
right next to the canal.<br />
If you have the time, follow the quiet canal to the south west, and
after about 1 km you will reach the centre of Naas. A stroll
through the town with its colourful pubs and storefronts and the
remains of St. David's castle is definitely worth its while! For
more info see www.naas.ie. If you want to find out more about our
hometown Essen, check out www.essen.de <br />

 <br />
<br />
<p>Be extra careful when you retrieve the cache and PRETTY PLEASE!
rehide it exactly as it is hidden since otherwise it may wind up in
the water. And so may you or the next cacher. ;-) Have fun now!</p>
