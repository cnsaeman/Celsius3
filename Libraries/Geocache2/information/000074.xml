<i>Take a look beyond the bulwark of woven gates<br />
At the top of Blessington Street,<br />
And marvel at the serenity which infiltrates<br />
Into a garden, lost and discreet.<br />
A quiet oasis, far from the blare of the city strife,<br />
Where a moment of peace may be found,<br />
A spot where perennial blooms come to life,<br />
Where birds make a pleasant sound.<br />
Who would have thought such a place could endure<br />
In a world with noise so afflicted?<br />
Yet this garden remains remote and secure,<br />
Where blessings abound unrestricted.<br />
If your mind’s in a whirl, or your worries increase,<br />
And life seems quite incomplete,<br />
Take time off to stroll to this garden of peace …<br />
To the basin in Blessington Street.<br /></i> <br />
(Noel Manly) <br />
<br />
 Water supply to the city was proving a difficulty to the City
Corporation in the later half of the eighteenth century. The City
Corporation saw the completion of the canals as a way of supplying
water to the city centre and reservoirs were built on the Royal and
Grand Canals. With the construction of the Royal Canal in 1775, a
spur was built to Broadstone, and the City Basin at Blessington
Street constructed alongside. The basin was developed to supply
water to the north of the city and supplied water to the two large
distilleries of Powers (Thomas Street) and Jameson's (Bow Lane) and
this continued until the 1970s.<br />
<br />
 The Basin was completely refurbished in 1993/94 with the help of
Fas and financial contributions from the National Heritage Council
and ALONE. Now this quiet haven in a bustling metropolis provides a
secret garden for local residents and visitors alike. This is now
one of the most unusual parks in the city, as eighty percent of the
area of the park is water. The park can be accessed from
Blessington Street, and the linear park which is now the former
Broadstone spur of the Royal Canal, as well as a few quieter
streets in the area.<br />
<br />
 An artificial island has been developed in the centre to create a
refuge for the ducks and swans who regard the basin as home.
Blessington Basin is now an oasis of calm in the city, surrounded
by high stone walls and lined with plants and seating.<br />
<br />
 The park is a 10 minute stroll from O Connell street. Just keep
heading north-west up Parnell Square East and North Frederick
Street until you reach the north end of Blessington Street. While
the street boasts many examples of once glorious Georgian
buildings, the visible signs of decay and unswept rubbish hint at
the fact that the area is only a shadow of its former self. <br />
<br />
After you have finished in the park, if you feel like a short
enjoyable stroll, head out the western gate of the park, turn right
and follow the former route of the spur from the canal along what
is now a very pleasant narrow park that ends near the heart of the
suburb of Phibsboro. <br />

TFTC GudrunXY</li><li>2010-05-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by Sandfly tucker <br />This was the first cache we found on our Irish trip, but we couldnt get to it due to a muggle sitting on his door step nearby. We were milling around deciding what to do when a lady from the council came and asked if we were looking for the GPS thingy. we fessed up and she told us she had accidently found it a while ago, looked up the site and even though she remains muggle she keeps an eye on it and makes sure it is hidden in the right place. Muggles can be useful. We returned later tonight and signed the log.
cheers and thanks from New Zealand.
