  <long-description>St. Colmcille's Well, Ballycullen Road, Tallaght - The widely known Shrine and Well of St. Columcille at Ballycullen lies off the Old Ballycullen Road within the boundary of St. Annes parish. The shrine was set up through the efforts of Fr. Philip Doyle and Fr. Malachy Hughes both of the Augustinian order. The project came about when Fr. Doyle noticed that the local postman had a habit of disappearing into a field close by whilst on his rounds. Subsequently Fr Doyle learned that there was a well situated in this field which was venerated locally in the name of St. Columcille.  It was discovered that the postman Pat Murray, never passed the place without dropping in to say a prayer at the well and to take a drink from its waters, doing what his father and grandfather had done before him, and in doing so following the same custom of the people in the district. According to local history, St Columcille rested here after a long walk from Glasnevin. (Bring it on Moonshiner!)  It was believed that he quenched his thirst from the sparkling spring and left a blessing on it and all who might come to drink from it thereafter. In June 1922 the well and shrine were formally blessed and the shrine became more widely known and the number of pilgrims increased. A tree guarded gateway admits the pilgrim who must then cross the small footbridge spanning the stream curving down past the shrine. Steps mounts to the small plateau and the eye is drawing to the white statue of the saint, bearing  the traditional staff and satchel and at his sandaled feet the well glints in the sunlight.


Please rehide well as this is a regularly visited area.

Don't read the hint unless you really need it, couldnt get a repeatable fix on this one every time so hint is a spoiler.</long-description>
