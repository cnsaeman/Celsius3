  <description>This 2-part multicache is easily accessible by DART or bus.
However, in order to complete the journey you will need a boat.
Hiring one on the spot has unfortunately become unreasonably
expensive: €35 per person, as of December 2007. Therefore, I'm
going to archive this cache soon.</description>
  <long-description>The first location at the coordinates above is a virtual cache.
Here you can reflect on how life was before GPS. What you will find
there is Killiney <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon">NDB</a>
(Non-Directional Beacon), which was (and may still occasionally be)
used as an aviation navigational aid, primarily for the Dublin
Airport air traffic. The beacon’s frequency is 378 kHz and its
callsign is <a href=
"http://worldaerodata.com/wad.cgi?nav=KILLINEY&nav_id=KLY&nav_type=5">
KLY</a>, which can be heard in Morse code on AM radios that receive
this band (794 metres). 
<p>To find the clue to the second (final) location, answer the
question: “Who provided the item in the enclosure?” Use the answer
to find the coordinates:</p>
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td align="right">5<b>N</b>°</td>
<td align="center"><b>F</b>6.<b>AR</b>9'</td>
<td>North</td>
<td rowspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;(final location).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">6°</td>
<td align="center"><b>Q</b>5.<b>U</b>49'</td>
<td>West</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>The cache at the second location is in a clear plastic container
in the shape of a small bucket, prominently marked. The easiest way
to get there is through the following coordinates:</p>
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td align="right">5<b>N</b>°</td>
<td align="center"><b>W</b>6.496'</td>
<td>North</td>
<td rowspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;(intermediate location).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">6°</td>
<td align="center"><b>Q</b>5.<b>R</b>98'</td>
<td>West</td></tr></table></blockquote>
Additional hint number 1 can help you decode the coordinates. Hints
2 and 3 will assist you if you get stuck on the way to the second
location. If you availed of any of the hints below, please write in
your log entry which hints you used. 
<p>Enjoy!</p></long-description>

  <encoded-hints>1. Replace each letter with the number of times it appears in the answer.
      For verification, the sum of all latitude digits is thirty one, and the sum of all longitude digits is twenty four.
  2. Hire a boat to the island from Coliemore harbour.  You can do it upon arrival or by phone at two eight three four two nine eight.
  3. The container is in the rocks in a fern field between the Martello tower and some old ruins occupied by goats.  It is hidden in a crevice between two large rocks and partly covered by two small rocks.

  <logs><ul><li>2009-09-26T19:00:00Z : Found it by didi2206 <br />Took a RIB over having sorted out the clue in Killiney hill a few days ago.. lovely dry evening,, nice cache in good condition.
Took little red robot toy, left UK 5p coin. TFTC!</li><li>2009-05-11T19:00:00Z : Write note by Cetus <br />Good to know the cache is in a good condition and the ferry prices are reasonable -- many thanks to daraconn and toczygroszek for checking up on it.  In fact, it was the €35 ferry rip-off that was my primary reason for wanting to archive this cache.  As I can't maintain the cache myself anymore, I'll be delighted to offer it to Dara for adoption if he still wants it.</li><li>2009-05-10T19:00:00Z : Write note by daraconn <br />As noted by toczygroszek, the cache is still there and in amazingly good condition.

There was a ferry service running today - a quick little Zodiac-style RIB zipping back and forth between Coliemore Harbour and the island, for €10 return per person. The island was full of visitors.

Unfortunately my own boat had a little accident - it was stranded on the rocks by the outgoing tide, and in the attempt to refloat it the outer hull was damaged by a sharp rock. We didn't realise the extent of the damage until we returned to Dún Laoghaire harbour - two holes in the underside of the boat. Nonetheless it remained afloat and stable and got us safely back to the harbour.

We also took the opportunity to visit the Muglins, a smaller island 500 m east of Dalkey Island.</li><li>2009-05-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by toczygroszek <br />It was amazing trip! Started looking for this cache one year ago, solved all stages except final location, what was on the island. Few days ago Dara asked me if I want go to island by his boat, so I was very excited and my answer was "yes, of course!". Weather today was brilliant, and many people were on island. Spotted one rabbit, group of goats, seals and many birds. It's really lovely spot, pity is so hard go there.
Cache was in brilliant condition, items inside looks like placed yesterday. There is log written in 2008 what is not on this page. Prevoiuos are left in 2006, so isn't a busy cache :)

Many thanks for this cache and excellent EXPERIENCE!

And thanks to Dara of course!!!
