  <long-description><p>One part of a wooden shipwreck least likely to be smashed was
the figurehead. There are many accounts of wrecks in Skerries which
mention that a figurehead was washed ashore. Many were placed in
gardens as ornaments and rotted away. . ."</p>
<p>"One of the most remarkable was the Man O War which used to
reside on a plinth outside the pub in the district of that name.
There was great mystery and confusion about the origin and
representation of the figure. Some sources even alleged that the
figure was stone."</p>
<p>The pub itself is said to have been constructed around an old
drinking tree, if that is so then maybe it’s the same tree that can
be seen in the lounge of the pub to this day.</p>
<p>Research has elucidated much of the history, but the classical
scholarship of Cormac Lowth identified the figurehead as a
representation of Hercules clad in the skin of the Nemean lion
which he slew as his first labor. There was a ship named Hercules
lost on the Irish coast on 22/3/1799 but the exact location is
unclear . . .</p>
<p>"The subjects of figureheads were varied. Deep sea vessels
tended to have human figures. . . The more profitable the trade the
more likely the ship was to have a figurehead. . . Warships tended
to have huge elaborate figureheads to symbolize power and majesty.

in 1796 the Royal Navy ceased fitting figureheads to new
ships."</p>
