  <long-description><p>Situated in the grounds of Howth Castle lies the remains of what
would of been a huge megalithic monument, the now slipped quartzite
capstone weights an estimated 75 tons which would place it second
in size to Brownes Hill dolmen in County Carlow. The portal tomb is
aligned South East and the two portal stones,each one an estimated
2 1/2 metres high, and door stone still remain. You can see in the
picture middle left where the capstone has slipped backwards from
the portal stones.</p>
<br />
<p>Folklore: Known locally as Aideen's grave this tomb is said to
be the burial place of Aideen the wife of Oscar the son of Oisin.
Oscar the bravest of all the Fianna slew three kings in his first
battle, he died at the battle of Gabhra and it is said that Aideen
died in grief at her loss, so Oisin buried her at Howth and set a
cairn over her, a burial usually reserved for great warriors or
kings.</p>
<br />
<p>Directions: From Dublin take the R105 North, as you come into
Howth look for signs for Deer Park Hotel and Golf course on the
right, drive into the grounds past Howth Castle and up to the Car
park. Walk to the right of the Hotel and look for the path between
the hotel and the pitch and putt course. Follow your GPSr from
here.</p>
<br />
<p>It is highly recommended to take the spoiler picture as the tree
coverage is very dense. Please refer to the hints for full details.
There is public access through the golf course to this important
monument.</p>

We lucked out by coming at this time of year, I have never seen such big & beautiful rhododendron's.
Many thanks for the cache & for bringing us here.

#341</li><li>2010-05-04T19:00:00Z : Found it by Crannyn <br />One of my favourite places for a walk.Love the flowers! Junior crannyn was disappointed as there was no TB. TFTC</li><li>2008-11-09T20:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Headed out this way with Anton and Gavin. I'd never seen the castle before so that was pretty cool :)

Once we got to the hotel I popped inside and some directions as to the easiest access to the grave.

Grave itself is a little run down, but still looks pretty cool.

The spoiler photo is spot on and after initially looking a tad too far away we very soon had the cache in hand.

Contents were mainly golf balls and tees so we dropped in some other goodies, including a nice coin.</li></ul></logs>
