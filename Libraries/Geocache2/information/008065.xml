  <long-description>The man who first coined the term "electron" (in 1891)is buried
here - George Stoney. A nearby road is named after him- Stoney
Road, surprisingly enough! There is another Stoney Road in the
North side of Dublin, named after his brother, who was a famous
engineer and pioneered a new method of building piers and harbour
walls, notably the North Wall in Dublin.</long-description>
