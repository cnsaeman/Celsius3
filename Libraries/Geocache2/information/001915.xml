  <long-description><p>Clontarf became a significant location in Irish History, more
than a century before Clontarf castle was built.<br />
 Brian Boru, the Ard Rí (High King) of Ireland, and the famous
Battle of Clontarf, on Good Friday, 23rd April 1014, will always be
associated with the Clontarf area.</p>
<p>It all began when Mael Morda, King of Leinster, began to plot
against Brian Boru.<br />
 Mael Morda made an alliance with Sitric, the Viking King of
Dublin, who was assisted by the Vikings of the Orkney Islands and
the Isle of Man.<br />
 Brian Boru marched against them and the great battle was fought at
Clontarf.</p>
<p>It ended in victory for Boru's army. However, on the night of
the victory, Boru was praying in his tent, surrounded by five men,
who were guarding him.<br />
 A small group of Vikings, who were retreating from the battle
through a wooded area, close to the site of what is now Clontarf
Castle, came across the guarded tent.<br />
 Realising who was being protected; they killed all five guards and
went on to kill Brian Boru.</p>

<p>In 1172 Hugh de Lacy built the castle as an inner circle of
defence sites protecting Dublin.</p>
<p>In 1835 the original building was unsafe, the problem being
sinking foundations and it was demolished & rebuilt by
1837.</p>
<p><b>Recent History :</b></p>
<p>By the 1960's, the castle was owned by the Regans, who extended
the Castle to cater for the wedding trade and growing cabaret
trade, which was run throughout the year.<br />
 In 1972, Gerry and Carmel Houlihan bought the castle and ran it as
one of Ireland's best cabaret venues until April 1997, when the
last cabaret show was staged.</p>
<p>The Castle was closed from June 1997 and reopened in June 1998,
as the hotel you see today.</p>

TFTC, eve</li><li>2010-06-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by GudrunXY <br />Found with eve1987 on our caching tour through Ireland.
At the second attempt it was quite easy.
TFTC, GudrunXY</li><li>2010-05-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by tmob <br />#2403

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

We passed nearby and decided to stop to visit the [i]High King[/i]'s castle.

Thanks for this one...
Greetings from Portugal</li><li>2010-05-12T19:00:00Z : Found it by B&B04 <br />A quick found.
Thanks for the micro.</li><li>2010-05-09T19:00:00Z : Found it by salt'n'light <br />Passed the late Gerry Ryan's home on the way here.
He will be missed.
TFTC</li><li>2009-04-20T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />I love this place - absolutely beautiful, well done in terms of modernisation. The only let down is the pathetic information sheet they give about it's history. Cache was easily found. TFTC</li></ul></logs>
