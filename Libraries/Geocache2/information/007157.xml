  <long-description><p><font size="4" face="Kristen ITC"><b>Glasnevin cemetery - The
History</b></font><br />
<font size="3" face="Kristen ITC">The largest cemetery in Ireland,
embodies the history of Ireland through its story & the famous
men & women buried here. It has acted as Ireland’s National
Cemetery & is the final resting place of those who have helped
shape modern Ireland.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC">It first opened its gates in
1832 after a series of events prompted Daniel O'Connell to
establish a burial place for the Catholic nation of Ireland.Prior
to the establishment of the Glasnevin Cemetery, Irish Catholics had
no cemeteries of their own in which to bury their dead & as the
repressive Penal Laws (enforced on the Irish since the 17th century
by the British) placed heavy restrictions on the public performance
of Catholic services, it had become normal practice for Catholics
to conduct a limited version of their own funeral services in
Protestant cemeteries.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC">This practice continued until
an incident at a funeral held in Dublin provoked public outcry when
a Protestant sexton reprimanded a Catholic priest for proceeding to
perform a limited version of a funeral mass. The event was the
final blow to the humiliation of the Catholic population. The
outcry prompted Daniel O'Connell, champion of Catholic rights, to
launch a campaign & prepare a legal opinion proving that there
was actually no law passed forbidding praying for a dead Catholic
in a graveyard. O'Connell pushed for the opening of a burial ground
in which both Irish Catholics & Protestants could give their
dead dignified burial.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC">With the passing of the 'Act
of Easement of Burial Bills' in 1824, a committee was formed to
administrate the proposed cemetery. A small plot of land had been
acquired for this purpose at Goldenbridge, Dublin but soon proved
insufficient. After some investigation, a second site amounting to
nine acres, was bought at Glasnevin - to be named Prospect
Cemetery. The land was consecrated by Monsignor Yore in September
1831 & its first internee, a Michael Carey from Francis Street,
Dublin, was buried in February 1832. Glasnevin Cemetery, as it is
now known, has grown from its original 9 to over 120 acres.
Approximately one and a half million men & women are laid to
rest there</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC"><b>Body
Snatchers</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC">The cemetery itself is
enclosed by a medieval style wall. Ten watchtowers stand
overlooking the grounds. The towers were erected during the 19th
century to deter body snatchers. These Bodysnatchers, or
'Sack-em-ups', made a living from stealing fresh corpses and
selling them on to the medical profession for dissection. Only with
the passing of the Anatomy Act of 1832 (which allowed for the
donation of bodies to medical science), did these activities
subside</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC"><b>Recent
History</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC">On 26th Sept '07 during the
deconstruction of the 1916 Sigerson Memorial in Glasnevin Cemetery,
workmen found a time capsule buried in in the masonry of the
memorial. Made of indestructible lead, it was found in a stone
canopy covering a beautiful sculpture — reminiscent of
Michaelangelo’s famous Pieta — by the late nationalist Mrs Dora
Sigerson Shorter.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC">Cylindrical in shape, it
measures three and a half inches in width and two feet in length
and has lead caps soldered on either end. It may have remained
unfound for many years only as the memorial was in a pretty bad
state, with shrubs and grass growing out of the roof, it was
decided that In order to restore it, it had to be disassembled with
the roof taken off the canopy which is where the long lead cylinder
was found in the stonework.</font></p>

     alt="Time Capsule" /></center>
<p><font size="3" face="Kristen ITC">After much debate, the
cylinder was replaced (unopened) back in the statue, after a search
of government records revealed it contained a vellum parchment
listing all those who died in the Easter rebellion of 1916 (which
is commemorated by the monument). But as the cylinder wasn't
opened, is that really what's inside it...</font></p>
