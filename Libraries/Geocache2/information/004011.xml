  <long-description><p align="justify">One of the most famous Dubliners is James Joyce
and the most famous novel written by him is "Ulysses". This story
is about one day (16.06.1904) in Leopold Bloom's (fictional
"antihero") life and his walk through Dublin. There are many
parallels to Odyssey (e.g. correspondence between Leopold Bloom and
Odysseus). The book is full of allusions, parallels and was very
controversial. In 1999, the Modern Library ranked Ulysses first on
its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th
century.<br />
<br />
Every year, on 16th June in Dublin people celebrate "Bloomsday", a
commemoration of James Joyce. They follow the Joyce's and Bloom's
footprints, some are dressed in Edwardian costumes and hard-core
enthusiasts read the entire novel during that day.<br />
<br />
The James Joyce Centre organizes walking tours of Dublin, where you
can visit places connected to Joyce or his fictional characters.
There are many plaques and sculptures in Dublin related to his work
and life and characters from his books (mostly to Bloom), so it is
hard to visit Dublin and not see any of them.<br />
<br />
In 1988 14 bronze plaques were installed in pavement along Bloom's
walk. Every plaque has a quotation related to the spot where it is
placed. Your task is to follow these plaques and collect some
information needed for the final cache location.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 1. (N 53° 20.902 W 006° 15.627)</b><br />
Which episode is this quotation from? Call it <b>A</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 2. (N 53° 20.880 W 006° 15.587)</b><br />
How many lines of text can you see? Don't count the page number
below the text. Call it <b>B</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 3. (N 53° 20.845 W 006° 15.571)</b><br />
There is a page number below the text. Add all digits together and
call it <b>C</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 4. (N 53° 20.805 W 006° 15.560)</b><br />
There is a number (written as a word) In this quotation. Call it
number <b>D</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 5. (N 53° 20.773 W 006° 15.538)</b><br />
How many words can you see in this quotation? Don't count the page
number at the bottom. Call it <b>E</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 6. (N 53° 20.712 W 006° 15.540)</b><br />
How many words can you see in the 4th line of the text? Call it
<b>F</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 7. (N 53° 20.586 W 006° 15.560)</b><br />
How many capital letters (big letters at the beginnings of words)
can you see? Call it <b>G</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 8. (N 53° 20.569 W 006° 15.566)</b><br />
How many letters are there in the 2nd word? Call it <b>H</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 9. (N 53° 20.539 W 006° 15.578)</b><br />
How many commas are there in the text? Call it <b>I</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 10. (N 53° 20.513 W 006° 15.559)</b><br />
This is the hardest part of your walk, because the plaque is
outside a pub (Davy Byrnes) where tables and chairs are placed.
Especially in the evenings this place is full of Muggles and it is
hard to read the quotation between their legs.<br />
If you can read this plaque count all words in it (excluding the
page number at the bottom) and call it <b>J</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 11. (N 53° 20.511 W 006° 15.539)</b><br />
How many letters are there in the last word? Call it
<b>K</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 12. (N 53° 20.505 W 006° 15.492)</b><br />
How many question marks can you see? Call it <b>L</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 13. (N 53° 20.471 W 006° 15.408)</b><br />
How many words are in the 1st line of the text? Call it
<b>M</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Plaque 14. (N 53° 20.435 W 006° 15.317)</b><br />
Note the last digit in the page number and call it <b>N</b>.<br />
<br />
 The final cache is at coordinates:<br />
<b>N 53° (K+A+M).(H-I)*(J*A*M-F*G*D)<br />
W 006° (J+C-D).(B*K-L)*(E-C+N)</b><br />
<br />
The cache is a magnetic micro container and contains a logbook and
a pencil.<br />
<br />
Watch out for Muggles!</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by eve1987 <br />A really great Multi-Cache. May be one of the best i've ever done.

We had a mistake at 'I' -  but with some help it worked!

Stage 10 was the funniest - 3 old ladies and a man sat on it. I told them we are playing a game and i have to take a photo of the placque. They stood up for and were very happy that they learned some new about their 'underground' [:D][:D][:D]

Thanks a lot for this one!!

Kind regards from Austria, eve</li><li>2010-06-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by GudrunXY <br />Eve1987 and me had a lot of fun doing this multi cache.
TFTC, GudrunXY</li><li>2010-05-30T19:00:00Z : Found it by THE_Chris <br />Got this baby on my second attempt, thanks to a tip from the cache owner. Basically I couldnt count commas properly.

Thought I'd be out of luck today again when I got to Stage 9 and there was a band set up on top of the plaque. Went up the road and did the Ein Stein cache and they were gone when I got back. Found easily at the final location, loved the hiding place too and the box/book was great.

Great multi this, TFTC!</li><li>2010-05-22T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by THE_Chris <br />Had a go at this today but no luck. Even Stage 10 was fine, with all the hot weather and everything. Every other table was full except for that, so I could see it.

Unfortunately where I ended up for the final stage had nothing that correlated with the hint so I must have made a bags somewhere. I'll be back!</li><li>2010-05-20T19:00:00Z : Found it by Asquith <br />#218 Great multi, thanks for showing me some of Joyce's Dublin.
Interesting location for the final, hadn't noticed it before.
At Plaque 10 I used the old photo trick. TFTC</li></ul></logs>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had a go at this today but no luck. Even Stage 10 was fine, with all the hot weather and everything. Every other table was full except for that, so I could see it.

Unfortunately where I ended up for the final stage had nothing that correlated with the hint so I must have made a bags somewhere. I'll be back!</groundspeak:text>

Interesting location for the final, hadn't noticed it before.
At Plaque 10 I used the old photo trick. TFTC</groundspeak:text>
