  <logs><ul><li>2009-10-11T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />Having found the travel bug last weekend, today I went with Ausra and Shiro to climb Knocknacloghoge and find the cache. It's the only summit in the area I had never visited before. Having considered a number of possible approaches, we decided to approach from the west, which is fairly flat, wet and boggy terrain with no paths. Tough going at times, but it got easier as we approached the hill and started climbing. It was very misty when we set out, but by the time we reached the summit the mist was starting to clear a little and we had some views of the lakes. When we finally got back to the car all three of us were up to our knees in muck. It was a 9 km round-trip, but some of those kilometres were pretty hard work!</li><li>2009-08-23T19:10:45Z : Enable Listing by toczygroszek <br />After 3 years non-existence of this cache I'm enabling it now. Necessary TB will place soon in some cache. </li><li>2009-08-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by theswerve <br />Very windy on top yesterday...good hide...Good to see this one back in action...TFTC..</li><li>2009-08-23T19:00:00Z : Owner Maintenance by toczygroszek <br />Cache replaced in new location</li><li>2009-08-23T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by toczygroszek <br />Tried find old container but looks is gone.

Don't worry, brand new container is placed in new location and cache will be acivated soon. [:D]</li></ul></logs>
