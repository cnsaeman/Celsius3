  <long-description><p>Flights at Dublin Airport were shut down due to a faulty €100
part in June.</p>
<p>The radar at the airport went down for 30 minutes and several
flights were delayed as a result worse was to come with the
cancelation of many flights over the next few days.</p>

Greetings from the Czech republic!</li><li>2010-05-29T19:00:00Z : Found it by lochb <br />I pulled up in front of the sign, and was just looking at my GPSr when an airport police car drove past me. They seemed tempted to stop, but continued when they saw me fiddle with the GPSr. Found and logged the find, returned it, and was setting up the GPSr for the next find when the police patrol came past again, slowed down, rolled down the window and asked if everything was OK. I told them that I now new where I was going and thanked them. Decided to head straight for Limerick then rather than go for more caches in the area.
