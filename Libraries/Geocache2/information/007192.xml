  <long-description><p><b>St Bridget</b></p>
<p>Daughter of Dubtach, pagan Scottish king of Leinster, and
Brocca, a Christian Pictish slave who had been baptized by Saint
Patrick. Just before Brigid's birth, her mother was sold to a Druid
landowner. Brigid remained with her mother till she was old enough
to serve her legal owner Dubtach, her father.</p>
<p><b>Holy Wells</b></p>
<p>The existence of holy wells in Ireland today offer an
opportunity to witness sacred sites and rituals that have continued
since prehistoric times. Where once a sacrifice may have taken
place, today a bride might look into the waters for inspiration or
good luck; a cripple might bathe in the waters in search of a cure.
Often the stations of the cross are prayed or a special Mass is
said. A ritual practice dating from prehistoric times and
continuing today is that of circumambulation, or making structured
rounds of the well, always in a clockwise direction.</p>
<br />
The Celts, a grain-cultivating, cattle-raising people, had a strong
religious influence on the native Irish. One of the features of
Irish Celtic cosmogony is the power of place. This, to an
earth-centered religion (i.e. goddess as opposed to the god in the
sky), means that certain places possess power that is curative and
regenerative. This power of place in Ireland is an essential
element of the sacredness of the holy well. <br />
There are different types of wells, briefly one might say that
prior to the coming of St. Patrick, and the sacred springs
reflected the Celtic earth-centered spirituality. After Patrick,
there occurred a shift to "Christianize" the pilgrimages and
practices associated with the wells. So the loric phenomena
associated with many of the wells was revalorized in terms and by
symbols universally understood in Christianity a crossing of the
boundary between the two cultures. The pagan tree took on the
symbolism of Christ (i.e. the cross) and there sprang up throughout
the country St. Patrick wells and also St. Bridget wells.<br />
<br />
 
<p>This spring is located behind the local Roman Catholic Church in
the village of St. Margaret’s in north Co. Dublin. Spring water is
contained in a large rectangular well chamber approximately 6 m
long by 3 m wide. An overflow pipe leads to a ditch which carries
water at times of high spring discharge. The substratum appears to
be semi-natural and consists of rocks, cobbles, pebbles, and some
mud. Evidence indicates that this spring completely dries out each
year, usually during the summer period although anecdotal evidence
also indicates that the spring well retained water throughout the
year before approximately 1980.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by Serapis <br />I was stumped here before and my maths obviously was wrong (but not that wrong as to put it somewhere mad). Today I found the cache quickly in the end. The well was still dry. Interesting to see the inscription of the St Brigids cross ‘tilted’ to one side as a sort of an X shape as opposed the more usual + shape. It could be a Masonic plot. Or there again it mightn’t be… Anyway thanks for the cache. Signed log. Serapis.


</li><li>2010-05-08T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />This was a 'Windsockers' themed day of cache finds around the airport.  This was #6 of 7.

We met the proprietor of the nearby church and he seemed totally bemused but pleased that locals would be walking to look at the well.  This is my favourite sort of cache.  I love finding ancient places that I never knew existed.

Ofcourse got the number wrong and ended up in to the field. Returned to the well, got the number right and found the cache without any problems!

TFTC!</li><li>2010-02-07T20:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />First find of the day on a trip around the Swords area. Found the well easily enough & worked out the co-ords for the cache. After a while looking we reassesed & then found the cache.

#171</li><li>2010-02-07T20:00:00Z : Found it by Blue Jay 59 <br />Interesting place and nice history too. I wonder is this the same St.Bridget from my parish? 
The curse is a bit scary, I preferred the blessing on the other side [:)]
How do you find these places??
Arrived in time for all the mass going muggles to pour out, but they didn't bother us and we didn't bother them.
Found the clues and then found the cache.
