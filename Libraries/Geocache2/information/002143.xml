  <long-description>Set in the environs of Powerscourt House. There is a fee to tour
the house and the gardens - if you are visiting the shop, however,
there is no fee. You know what to do! Just tell the person in the
kiosk at the main gate that you are visiting the shop and proceed
to the car park. Incidentally, a "ha-ha" is a sunken road - the
purpose of which was to allow traffic to move around the estate
without sullying the eyes of those in residence in the house.</long-description>
