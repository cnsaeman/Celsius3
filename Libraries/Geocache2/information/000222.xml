Brought a bespoke 'cache retrieval tool' (bent coat hanger) as I believed it must be shoved away out of reach. Spent 30 minutes up to my shoulder trying to get at it. Still nothing. Then got a text from the other half of fitzet saying cache was found today. Realised that spot I was searching in was undisturbed (except by me) so had a rethink. Found it right away. No need for pokey tool. GAH! the moral of the story is just read the hint!!!!!!
Took a coin.
