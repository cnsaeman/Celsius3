  <long-description><p>Ardgillan is a very well preserved castle near Skerries to the
North of Dublin, surrounded by beautiful gardens and set in a great
landscape.<br />
A visit to the castle is highly recommended.</p>
<p><b>The Yew Walk</b></p>
<p>One surviving feature still intact in the garden is the Yew Walk
which lies to the south of the house and is seen as one approaches
from the entrance at Blackhills. This was planted in 1800's during
the lifetime of Marianne Taylor, wife of Rev. Henry Edward Taylor.
It was the favourite walk of Captain Edward Taylour (1863 - 1938).
Local folklore has it that a shadowy figure sometimes seen here is
the ghost of a member of the Taylour family.</p>
From the cache, you will have spectacular views over the grounds
and on a clear day you can see the Mourne mountains in the
distance.<br />
 
<p><b>Getting There</b></p>
<p>There are two ways to get to this cache: from the main car park
at N 53 34.922 W 006 09.645,<br />
 or the pedestrain route at the "Ladies Stairs" at N 53 35.473 W
006 09.365.</p>
<p>If you want to visit this cache using public transport, the bus
route to take from Dublin City centre is the No. 33 which will drop
you off at the "Ladies Stairs" on the road between Balbriggan and
Skerries, the pedestrian entrance to the Demesne via a bridge which
spans the road and railway line. Alternatively, you can take the 41
from Dublin City Centre to Swords, and then take the 33A (which
from Swords on follows the same route as the 33).</p>
<p><b>Note that access to the grounds is open from 10am to 5pm in
the Wintertime, and 10am to 9pm in the summer (June, July and
August).</b></p>
