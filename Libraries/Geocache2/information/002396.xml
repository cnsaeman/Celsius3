  <long-description><p>A quick cache and dash but some discretion will be required as
the store is very busy.<br />
Cache is a magnetic in a public location and contains only a
log.The area is Not entirely wheelchair-friendly as some reaching
is required.</p>
<p>There is no access to this cache from the sliproad of the M50 so
don't be tempted to try it.</p>
<p>Please take care and rehide the cache to prevent muggles from

Saw this one published last night and figured FTF was gone already. Sauntered over after 11 this morning and found the cache quickly & not surprisingly signed already. Nice cache n'dash. Never been here before. I hear it's mental busy sometimes so I was glad the place was deserted when I was there. 

TFTH!
