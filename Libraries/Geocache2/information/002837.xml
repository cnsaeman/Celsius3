My love and I would lie,<br />
And see the coloured counties,<br />
And hear the larks so high<br />
About us in the sky.<br />
<br />
The bells would ring to call her<br />
In valleys miles away:<br />
"Come all to church, good people;<br />
Good people, come and pray."<br />

And I would turn and answer<br />

And come to church in time."<br />

I always wondered about the mountain or bit of mountain that
adjoins the Sugarloaf to the right as you see it from the N11.
Looking at the OSI map the area is called Glencap Commons North but
when I went to investigate I decided to move just a little further
again away from the Sugarloaf to a small separate hump which I have
decided to call "The Sugarlump"!!<br />
This is where I have hidden the cache and together with "Sweet
Hiking" and the "Sugar" cache it makes for a nice total hike of
about 2 hours, 5K and 250M ascent, to take in all three. In the
case of this cache, all you have to do is pick up a little
information at the parking area, or Stage 1, and the rest is
simple. The little dip before you reach the final "Lump" can be a
bit soggy after rain so good shoes or boots may be required. If you
decide to go directly from the summit of the Sugarloaf to this
cache it will be very rocky and ankle twisting terrain. Just be
aware of it as it is possible to circumvent the base of the
Sugarloaf to get to this cache and the going is much easier.<br />
<br />
Stage 1:<br />
In the parking area at N53 08.675 W006 09.279 you will find the
last 3 numbers of N (the top ones, call them ABC) and W (the bottom
ones, call them DEF) of the final coordinates.<br />
The final coordinates will then be: N53 09.ABC W006 09.DEF<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><font size="4"><b>Do not start the trek without
all the proper mountain rain gear, waterproof boots and the
guidance material, compass, map, GPSr with mapping etc.<br />
<br />
Please note that all parts of this cache are hiked at your own
risk. The cache owner takes no responsibility of any sort for any
reason including accidents or
mishaps.<br /></b></font></font><br />
<br />
<font color="red"><font size="4">Please be aware that cars parked
in areas close to walking trails are vulnerable and they can be
vandalised or stolen. Unfortunately this is an ongoing problem
which is extremely difficult to solve, so there is a risk
involved.<br />
<br />
Please observe the country code to the best of your ability. Local
landowners often generously allow access to upland areas across or
through parts of their private property. Please, please be
conscious of this and return the courtesy by keeping all gates
closed, immediately and not on your way back!. Please use the gates
where appropriate but if you have to climb over them then use the
hinged side ONLY.<br />
Please do not cause any damage of any sort to fences or barriers
along the way.<br /></font></font><br />
