  <long-description><p>On the hills overlooking Barnageeragh bay stands Ardgillan
castle, which was originally known as Prospect, because of the fine
view from there of Skerries and the coast northwards to the Mourne
Mountains. The castle is situated on 194 acres of land.</p>
<p>The extensive parkland which surrounds the house has a series of
woodland walks running through it. These were originally laid out
by the Taylor family for their women folk. The parkland is
connected to a section of Barnageeragh beach by a footbridge across
the road and railway. This footbridge is called the Lady's stairs
and the section of the beach to which this bridge led was private
and known as "The Lady's" Bathing place.</p>
<p>The back door of Ardgillan, which looks out on to a terrace
lined with yew trees, is connected to the front door through a
series of passageways. Down one of these passageways is a glass
door which leads to the cellars.</p>
<p>In 1737 this property was purchased from a Dublin wine merchant,
Robert Usher, by Captain Taylor. After Captain Taylor died,
Mrs.Taylor decided to move from Ardgillan and live in Meath.
Accordingly she dismissed her staff, but agreed that her gardener
could use the gardens in exchange for taking care of the castle
grounds. She also left him keys to the castle.</p>
<p>Some months later, the gardener’s two sons were working on the
terrace when they heard footsteps coming down a flight of stairs in
the house. The footsteps approached the terrace door, and then
stopped. Suspecting an intruder, the two men looked in a window but
saw no one. They then checked all the doors, and found them
securely locked.</p>
<p>When they told their father the story, he laughed, but later he
told them his own story:</p>
<p>A few years earlier, he had cause to return to the castle at ten
o’clock at night. Carrying a basket of vegetables, he entered the
house by the terrace door and walked along the passage to the
kitchen. Passing the glass cellar door, he saw a woman dressed in
white standing behind it. Thinking she was locked in, he moved to
open the door and the lady vanished. Puzzled, he continued on to
the kitchen and left the basket on the table. On his return, the
figure was again standing behind the glass door. Once more the
gardener tried to make contact with her, but she disappeared.</p>
<p>Some time later, the gardener mentioned the apparition to Mrs.
Taylor, who revealed that she, had been visited by another spirit,
her son, who appeared and talked with her four nights after his
death.</p>
<p>No other sightings of the son have been reported, but it is said
that the <b>"White Lady"</b> can be seen on the Lady’s Stairs.</p>
<p><b>Getting there</b></p>

route to take from Dublin City centre is the No. 33 which will drop
you off at the "Ladies Stairs" on the road between Balbriggan and
Skerries,Alternatively, you can take the 41 from Dublin City Centre

same route as the 33).</p>
