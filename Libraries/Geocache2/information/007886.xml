  <description>Small cache hidden in Knocksink Wood Nature Reserve. This cache is
on the <b>south</b> side of the Glencullen River. The trail is
muddy so good boots are recommended.</description>
  <long-description><p><a href="http://www.knocksinkwood.org/setting.php">Knocksink
   Wood Nature Reserve</a> is near Enniskerry Village, on the banks
   of the Glencullen River. This stretch of river is particularly
   scenic, with torrents, small cascades and miniature gorges. Care
   is needed, especially with small children, as there are some
   steep drops.</p>
<p>These woods are rich in plant and animal life, and shelter
diverse habitats within a relatively small area. Please note that
this area is a Nature Reserve, so particular care should be taken
to observe the principles of Leave No Trace, and to refrain from
harming or disturbing the plants and animals.</p>
<br>
Special thanks to the National Parks and Wildlife Service for their
kind permission to place the cache. <br>
