  <long-description><p>This cache was inspired largely by an interesting book written
by Mick O’Farrell and published by Mercier Press (A Walk Through
Rebel Dublin 1916 – ISBN 1-85635-276-5). To get the full flavour,
you should purchase a copy and visit each location with the text in
hand – it will give you a different view on Ireland past and
present.</p>
<p>To get to the cache area is very straightforward – either by car
or by public transport (DART to Lansdowne Road, or bus routes –
Aircoach or Dublin Bus routes 7 & 45).</p>
<p>Mount Street Bridge was seen by the rebels as one of the key
strategic points of access to Dublin and they deployed men
accordingly. Our first point is at coordinates N 53 19.937 W 006
14.125, on the corner of Pembroke Road and Northumberland Road.
Carisbrook House is currently a bank building, but in 1916, on this
site, there was an imposing residence on a direct route from Dun
Laoghaire (where British troops were landed) to Dublin city. The
rebellion had commenced on Easter Monday, 24th April, 1916 – this
was Wednesday morning, 26th April, and the closer the troops got to
the city, the greater was their wariness.</p>
<p>They had set out from Dun Laoghaire at around 10 am on Wednesday
morning and were generally welcomed by residents along the way,
with pots of tea, sandwiches and fruit. At about midday, the column
of men rested near Carisbrook House, smoking, eating fruit and
chatting with civilians who gathered around. All of a sudden
several volleys of sniper fire shattered the calm – thinking
Carisbrook House was the source of the gunshots, the soldiers took
cover and peppered the house with bullets.</p>
<p>(A) Take a note of the 4th digit in the telephone number on the
alarm box on Carisbrook House</p>
<p>(B) Across the road on a traffic island, there is a small kiosk
/ shop - take a note of how many sides there are to this small
building</p>
<p>The house had been occupied by rebels briefly on the previous
Monday, but they had all left at this stage – there were still some
volunteer snipers, who fire several volleys of revolver shots at
the soldiers before withdrawing. Carisbrook House was soon occupied
by some of the troops, while the rest regrouped and marched on
towards 25 Northumberland Road, Mount Street Bridge and Clanwilliam
House towards an engagement which would be arguably the most famous
struggle of the whole insurrection.</p>
<p>25 Northumberland Road (N 53 20.166 W 006 14.293) was chosen by
the rebels for its excellent position commanding the route from Dun
Laoghaire to the city via Mount Street Bridge. The house had been
evacuated by the sympathetic owners and was occupied by Lieutenant
Michael Malone and Section Commander James Grace (two younger
rebels were with them at first, but were sent home by Malone).</p>
<p>When the British soldiers approached No. 25, ten were felled by
the first volley from the house, beginning what was to be five
hours of fierce fighting. The fire from No. 25 was augmented by
fire from Clanwilliam House , on the far side of Mount Street
Bridge. Eventually, the house was stormed by the troops and taken –
Malone was shot dead as he came down the stairs to meet them and
Grace escaped into the kitchen, and thence into another garden
where he hid in a shed, only to be arrested some days later.</p>
<p>(C) Take a note of the number of floors / storeys at the front
of No. 25</p>
<p>The capture of Mount Street Bridge (N 53 20.247 W 006 14.424)
was the goal of the advancing British troops, who were halted by
fusillades fro No. 25, the Parochial Hall and the Schoolhouse on
the other side of the road, and Clanwilliam House on the other side
of the canal. There was minimal cover near the canal – just a low
wall behind which the troops lay and crouched, with their packs
giving their positions away and the rebels simply blazed away at
the khaki humps.</p>
<p>Again and again, an officer would lead a charge over the bridge
– again and again they would be shot down, falling to join the heap
of bodies at the bridge. After a time, some civilians and staff
from nearby Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital were given permission by the
rebels to go to the aid of the wounded soldiers. There was only a
brief lull, though – soon a whistle blew and a wave of troops
charged the bridge and were promptly mown down. Every 20 minutes or
so, another whistle would blow and another wave of soldiers would
charge the bridge, only to be cut down to join the heaps of bodies
at the bridge’s entrance.</p>
<p>When the firing from Clanwilliam House seemed to stop (the
rebels had run out of ammunition) the Battle of Mount Street Bridge
was over, with 234 British soldiers killed – the number of rebels
in the area was 17. By Wednesday evening, Clanwilliam House was
ablaze and the rebels made their escape through a basement window
less than a foot square into the garden – of the seven rebels in
the building, four escaped capture and three died during the
fighting.</p>
<p>To find the cache, you must perform some calculations -</p>
<p>To N 53 19.935, add 0.[A][C-1][B+1]; to W 006 14.293, add
0.[A][A+1][B ]</p>
<p>As you walk towards the cache, you will see the minimal cover
offered by the wall alongside the canal to the British troops as
they tried to take cover from rebel fire.</p></long-description>
