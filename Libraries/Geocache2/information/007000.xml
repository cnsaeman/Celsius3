  <long-description>The cache is located in Glencree, Co. Wicklow. Terrain is good, but
be careful if it is wet. If there are children with you, keep them
close, as there is a river right beside the cache location. The
cache is covered by two stones, please replace stones as you found
them, or else the cache will be easly seen. Glencree is about 6
miles past Enniskerry Village. The best place to leave your car is
at N53 12.043 W6 17.532. (War Graveyard, have a look when your're
done caching) From here the cache is a 5 minute walk. Start walking
back down the road you just came up. The path starts at a telephone
pole, and at this pole you can look down and see a grotto.<br />

Many thanks for showing us this place.
We searched without the spoiler and found a big container without logbook so we thought at first the cache was muggled.
Luckily we looked a second time and found the cache.

Thanks for the cache.
