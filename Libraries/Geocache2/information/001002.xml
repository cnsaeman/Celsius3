  <long-description>Skerries has five islands off its coast. These are Shenick Island,
St Patrick's, Colt and Rockabill. Rockabill is in fact two islands,
the Rock and the Bill, separated by a narrow channel. There is also
Red Island which, despite the name, is actually a tombolo.

 The town
itself is built around two long streets - Strand Street and Church
Street and between the surrounding hills of North Fingal and
low-lying beaches. Red Island, Mill Hill, Hillside, The public
Ardgillan Park and Demesne, Barnageera and to a lesser extent
Baldungan Castle are high points on which you can look over the
town.

 Baldungan Castle Rockabill has the largest numbers of
breeding Roseate Terns in Europe. It is also the farthest away from
the town and has a lighthouse. On Shenick Island can be found a
Martello tower, one of a number of defensive towers erected during
the Napoleonic era along the Irish coast by the British. Shenick is
accessible on foot at the lowest tides. The other islands are
harder to reach, but it is possible by boat. Red Island also has a
Martello Tower. St Patrick's Island is so called because this is
where the Irish patron saint is reputed to have landed and begun
his mission to convert the country to Christianity. It is also
known locally as Church Island.
