Cache information:<br>
 Don't fret if your GPS doesn't give you pin point accuracy as this
is a centre city cache where there are many obstructions that will
interfere. I have provided plenty of information here to help.<br>
As you will be very close to some of Dublin's most heavily visited
tourist attractions, numbers of people will be another difficulty
so be prepared for strange looks etc. The actual cache is small and
black and there is a magnet involved. You will have to be
"extremely" careful, even sneaky, when retrieving it and please be
equally circumspect when replacing it. The hint below may be
necessary in some cases.<br>
You will need your own pen and please write as small as
possible.<br>
1. The above coordinates will have you very close to a black and
yellow "H" (see details below about the House of Lords, well worth
a visit!). On a pavement shore you will find "IS 2?? Grade B".
Place a zero between the two figures of your answer (as I have
below) and then add 5.<br>
2. In the College grounds across the road at coordinates N53 20.667
W006 15.468 you will find information in brass in the cobbles. W?8.
Subtract 1 from the answer. <br>
3. No visit to Dublin, or indeed Ireland, is complete without a
visit to one of our greatest treasures. At N53 20.630 W006 15.396
you will find a date beside the name of Frances E Moran (near, but
outside the entrance). The date is 19?? Subtract 9 years then use
the last two figures of your answer.<br>
(NB as this clue has been temporarily removed I have to tell you to
simply to go back out the main college exit/entrance and proceed up
Grafton St to the bronze statue of quite a famous Dublin Lady. Take
it from there perhaps with the hint!) <br>
The cache is at N53 20 ?0?(answer 1.) W006 15 answer 2. (one
figure) and answer 3.(the remaining 2 figures) When you get close
you will know.<br>

The University of Dublin, Trinity College<br>
Visitor Attractions<br>
 The University of Dublin, founded in 1592, is the oldest
university in Ireland. Trinity College is the sole constituent
college of the University. At present there are over 12,000
students and 1,200 staff members working on the College campus.<br>
Standing on a self-contained site in the heart of Dublin, the
College covers some 40 acres of cobbled squares and green spaces,
around buildings which represent the accumulated architectural
riches of nearly three centuries. Its thirteen and a half thousand
staff and students form a compact academic community and are at the
same time an intimate part of the city's life. Dublin offers a
particularly congenial atmosphere for students and while small by
international standards, it has in all respects the resources of a
capital city with a full and varied cultural and intellectual life.
<br>
Trinity College is one of Irelands leading historical sites
attracting in excess of half a million visitors every year.
Heritage attractions available to visitors include<br>
<br>
The Book of Kells<br>
The Book of Kells is a 9th Century manuscript of the Gospels,
renowned world-wide for its rich and varied illustrations. It is on
display in the Old Library in Trinity College. The current
exhibition in the Colonnades, 'The Book of Kells. Picturing the
Word' places this national treasure in its historical and cultural
context. The Old Library is open 7 days a week. Admission from
9.30- 17.00 Monday to Saturday,9.30 to 16.30 on Sunday
(June-September) and 12.30-16.30 on Sundays (October-May). <br>
<br>
[Top] Now a well established attraction in Dublin, the Dublin
Experience is a major multi-media show which relates the history of
Irelands' Capital city through the most modern mediums available. A
dramatic script, stunning photography and evocative music combine
to give visitors and Dubliners alike an unsurpassed introduction to
the city. The Dublin Experience operates from mid May until the end
of September, 7 days a week with shows on the hour every hour
10a.m. to 5p.m. <br>
<br>
[Top] Walking Tours of the Campus Escorted by students, these
walking tours around the College Campus will provide any visitor
with an account of Trinity's past, a history of the Campus
buildings, and interesting anecdotes about its most famous
graduates. The tours run from mid-April until early October from
inside the Front Gate of the College. Tours commence every 40
minutes from 10.15am - there are generally 9 tours in any one day.
<br>
The Long Room, Old Library, Trinity College.<br>
<br>
<br>
The House of Lords, Old Irish Parliament Buildings, Bank of
Ireland, College Green, Dublin 2<br>
Designed by Edward Lovet Pearce, the Old Parliament House dates
from 1729. The House of Lords, a barrel-vaulted rectangle with
subsidiary vaulted square at one end and a semi-domed apse at the
other. The chamber has survived in the proportions and general
aspect which Pearse gave it. The most notable decoration of House
of Lords is provided by two tapestries by Johann van der Hagen
dating from 1733. These represent The Battle of the Boyne and the
Siege of Derry respectively. The original oak and Italian marble
mantelpiece still occupies its place in the left wall. The great
chandelier made up of 1233 separate pieces of glass dates from
1788. The Parliament House was the Head Office of the Bank of
Ireland until 1972.<br>
<br>
It is rumoured that there are underground passageways going from
this building to other major sites in the city centre like Dublin
Castle, the GPO and the Four Courts. It is even possible that these
were used by 1916 freedom fighters during the rising.<br>
Guided tours of House of Lords every Tuesday. (except Bank
Holidays)<br>
