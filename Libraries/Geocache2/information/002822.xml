 The earliest and most impressive large scale docks to be built in
Dublin were those at the Grand Canal. The docks consist of two
large rectangular basins joined together by a lifting bridge.
Opened in 1796, the new docks were equipped with three graving or
dry docks. The docks cover an area of 35 acres and the water is on
average 16 feet deep by the quayside. Silting outside the lock
gates made access difficult and the docks proved unsuccessful as a
financial venture. <br />
<br />
Today the docks area highlight a mixture of architecture from both
a bygone industrial age and the modern "Celtic Tiger" Dublin. The
mix works rather well, and the beautiful red brick warehouses sit
comfortably beside the modern glass office blocks. The southern
basin contains the excellent Waterways Visitors Centre, which is
currently being renovated. The northern basin has been radically
reworked in the last few years, with expensive apartments, modern
offices and trendy pubs.<br />
<br />
 The cache is a magnetic micro in a quiet part of the dock area. As
this is a residential area, please be wary of any eyes that may be
watching you from above, and replace the cache exactly as you found
it, ensuring is not visible. Beware, the water is deep near here,
but you will not need to be close to the water to find the cache.
Enjoy!<br />

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by Nachtwolf <br />Hello.
After our boating holydays on the beautiful River Shannon we spent a few days in Dublin.

I explored this interesting lively city on foot and visited some caches. I found this one without any problems.

Thank you for this nice cache and greetings from Germany.
Nachtwolf</li><li>2010-05-18T19:00:00Z : Found it by Takemountain <br />Thanks to the asch [:D] we could have another day of geocaching.

Very nice place, thanks for sharing this one!</li><li>2010-05-15T19:00:00Z : Found it by lamm4 <br />If you don't like to use a map beside the GPS you might come from the wrong side [B)]. Finaly found it easy. Nice view with this nice weather [8D] TFTC#137</li><li>2009-03-07T20:00:00Z : Found it by Mancunian Pyrocacher <br />yes I know I'm a bit late in logging this [:I], but my excuse is that as the UK is a lot busier than Eire cache wise. I've put my Geocaching time in publishing caches rather than log them [:D]

A interesting location, and a cache found with fine company.

Dave</li><li>2007-07-08T07:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Since this one was close enough to J's place that we could see it from his balcony we figured we should knock it over before the day got started. 

Great quiet little spot and an interesting array of water-life and death as well to be seen!

Cache in good condition.
