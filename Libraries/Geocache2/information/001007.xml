  <long-description>Cache Info:<br />
Cache is an ammo box hidden in some rocks at the above coordinates
very close to the actual summit and mast of Kippure. This cache
forms one of the highest points in each of the 32 counties of
Ireland<br />
<br />
Kippure, well known as the highest mountain in Co. Dublin, is a
granite mountain that straddles the County Dublin and County
Wicklow borders. Due to its proximity to Dublin, fine views over
Dublin Bay and the Howth peninsula, convenient access, and easy
terrain, Kippure is a popular place for hill walking and outdoor
leisure activities, especially on the weekends.<br />
<br />
The summit of Kippure is the site of a television and radio
transmitter mast, and as such is the oldest television transmitter
site in the Republic of Ireland. It was first identified as a
transmitter site as part of a Radio Éireann survey into potential
FM radio transmitter sites in the mid 1950s. The Irish government
Board of Works built an access road to the site in 1959, and by the
summer of 1961 the mast was erected and television trade test
transmissions, consisting of slide views of Ireland, a testcard and
the music of Count John McCormack were played out. <br />
At first, Kippure broadcast using the British 405-line TV standard
on channel 7. <br />
Telefís Éireann started transmissions from Kippure on 31 December
1961, to be followed by a 625-line service on channel H in the
summer of 1962. <br />
FM Radio transmissions of RTÉ Radio (the former Radio Éireann)
commenced in 1966, with stereo transmissions commencing in 1969.
<br />
405-line transmissions from Kippure ceased in 1978 with the arrival
of RTÉ 2, however Kippure did not transmit RTÉ 2 until much later.
Initially on Channel J with low power later moving to Channel H
with RTE1 moving to Channel E. <br />
Its importance in radio and television transmission has diminished
since the late 1970s with the opening of new sites at Three Rock
Mountain in County Dublin, Clermont Carn in County Louth, and Cairn
Hill in County Longford which provide better reception in most
areas previously served only by Kippure. Today Kippure transmits
the four Irish television channels, the national radio stations,
and some commercial radio stations.</long-description>
