  <long-description>The first part of the cache name is a personal tribute to a special place. 

Tandy's Bridge is yet another one of a series of bridges built over the Naas Branch of the Royal Canal toward the end of the 18th century. 

Tandy's Bridge is special to the Naas GAA because the first practice match of the Naas GAA John Dillons was held near there on Sunday the 30th October 1887. Teams led by J.J. Dowling and P.J. Doyle played a vigorous match won by Doyle's side. 

This cache is part of a series along the canal in Naas. The idea for the series was from our very first find at the nearby 'Ruhrgebiet meets Naas' cache. 

This is a nice, quiet hide and a place to sit down and have a little break from all the walking along the canal.

Difficulty changed to a 3 due to a number of DNFs. 

It is a small box wrapped in black fabric.</long-description>
