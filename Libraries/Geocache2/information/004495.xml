  <long-description><p>The cache is located on the old Swords Bridge which used to be
the main Dublin to Belfast road before the dual carriageway was
built, and the newer estuary bridge.</p>
<br />
<br />
Like the Flurry River bridge further north this bridge was the
scene of some tragic road crashes in its time. Unlike Flurry river
bridge there are no memorials on this bridge.<br />
The bridge has been transformed into a small roadside park.<br />

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-10T16:28:17Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />Oh my goodness. How to make something easy so difficult. I had a spare hour to find this in which should have been loads of time. Between missing the turn and missing the park I spent 45 minutes on back roads trying to find my way back again. With about 3 minutes to spare I found the park, abandoned the car and sprinted to ground zero, found the cache, signed the log and sprinted back to the car. Back in malahide then just in time to collect the kids. Let no one tell you that caching is a relaxing hobby!! Stress! 

SL TFTC!</li><li>2010-05-09T19:00:00Z : Found it by salt'n'light <br />Always nice to find these little 'forgotten' places.
But could be turned into a really lovely picnic spot with very little investment.
Still good cache spot!  Not too tricky.

TFTC</li><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by abra123cadabra <br />Nice old bridge with a sneaky little hide. First spot got the prize. This area is a favourite for people walking their dogs. Unfortunately they don't appear to train them where to do their business. The middle of the path is just fine. So watch where you put your feet! </li><li>2009-04-11T19:00:00Z : Found it by CheekyCheetah <br />Found when out with my parents (Frezeluberz)
