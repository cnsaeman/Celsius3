  <description>The above co-ordinates lead to the car park. <br />
You need to figure out the the puzzle to get to the
cache.</description>
  <long-description><p><b>The co-ordinates:</b></p>
N53° 17.ABC, W006° 10.DEF<br />
Solve the crossword below, and convert the letter in the squares
A,B,C,D,E,F to the number it occupies in the alphabet.<br />
 For example: a is 1, m is 13 and z is 26. <br />
 If this number is two digits, add the digits together (for example
u=21=3)<br />
Then substitute these numbers into the co-ords above. <br />
<b>Control:</b> If you have got it right, then A+B+C should equal
6, and D+E+F should equal 18. 
<p><br />
 <b>The cache:</b><br />
The cache is a micro placed in an area not many people know
about.<br />
This is a residential area, so try to park at the given
co-ords.<br />
Also, take care when retrieving and replacing the cache so as not
to be seen as there can be quite a few people in this area.</p>
<p><b>Getting there:</b><br />
From the N11, turn off (East) onto Stillorgan Park.<br />
The turn off is at a major crossroads, near the Leisureplex and
Blakes/ Bondi pub/ nightclub.<br />
Follow Stillorgan Park and take a right into St. Augustine's
Park.<br />
Park at the above co-ordinates.</p>

TNLN</li><li>2010-05-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />That is one mad looking 'structure' !

I had difficulty retrieving it cos it was pushed far back.
I've left it easier to access.

Used the hint.

Still, a bit of a think and using one of the clues given I quickly deduced that all I needed was to answer four of the clues correctly to work out the right coordinates. What an amazing place!
