The Howth Cliff Walk offers the walker a fine, varied walk around
an open hillside and the Howth cliffs, with the guarantee of
plentiful bird life, excellent sea views and colourful wild
flowers. <br />
<br />
The walk can be commenced at many different places along the route,
with many easy access points from various car parks that are
conveniently located close to the path. This caching trail
commences at the car park 1km to the east of the village (N53
23.137 W6 03.048) and moves slowly south, then west, but can also
be undertaken in a reverse order. <br />
<br />
While the main walk is generally not very steep, a couple of caches
may require some scrambling up brief stretches of steep terrain. As
always in Ireland it is advised to bring along good waterproof
clothing for the inevitable shower. Sturdy footware is also a must.
If you wish to undertake the entire walk in one go it makes sense
to bring a packed lunch and plenty of liquids, as the full journey
may take in the region of 4-5 hours. <br />
<br />
The Bailey Cache is located close to the Bailey lighthouse. There
has been a light on this part of Howth Head for over 300 years. The
first actual lighthouse wasn't built here until 1668, however. A
second lighthouse was built in 1790. These first lights were found
to be positioned too high and often obscured by fog, mist and low
clouds. The present structure was built at a lower elevation, below
the level of the cliff. It was originally painted white but was
restored to its natural granite in 1910. This light was the last of
all the Irish lighthouses to be automated. <br />
<br />
You will not need to enter the grounds of the lighthouse to find
this cache. Nor will you need to approach the cliffs. Use the clue
if in doubt. Happy caching!</long-description>
