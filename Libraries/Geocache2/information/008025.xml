  <description>A quick cache and dash along the N81.</description>
  <long-description>I have always slowed down whilst driving by this part of the N81 because of the beautiful views over Blessington resevoir with the Wicklow Mountains in the background.

There is room to park one or two cars however; this can be a particularily busy section of the road so be careful out there!!!  

p.s This is a micro cache so please bring your own pen!

I hope you enjoy it!</long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

We found this cache on our way to the Wicklow Mountains, nice viewpoint.

Thanks for this one...
