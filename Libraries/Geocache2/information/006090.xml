  <long-description><p>When St. Patrick was expelled from Wicklow by the pagan natives
he sailed northwards and landed on a small island off Skerries,
which is now known as St. Patrick's Island in his honour. When the
saint arrived on this island he had with him a goat, which was his
companion and source of milk. .</p>
<p>From this island St. Patrick came to the mainland to convert the
local people. While St. Patrick was ashore on one of these visits
some people from Skerries went out to the island and stole his
goat. They killed the goat, cooked it and feasted on it. When St,
Patrick went to the island he found his goat missing. This made him
very angry and in two giant strides he reached the mainland. The
first step took him to the back of Colt Island and the second to
Red Island, where he confronted the people of Skerries.</p>
<p>When they tried to deny interfering with his goat they found
they could only bleat. When they were prepared to tell the saint
the truth their voices returned.</p>
<p>Where St. Patrick stepped onto Red island his footprint is to be
seen in the rock to this day.</p>
<center>
<img src="http://www.northbeach.ie/gallery/albums/userpics/10001/footprnt.jpg" />
</center>
Since then the nickname Skerries Goats is given to the people of
the town to remind them of this deed .<br />
<br />
 
<p>St. Patrick's footprint can be seen on the rocks near the
Springboards, the tidal bathing place on Red Island.</p>
<p>There is supposed to be another impression of the saint's foot
on the rocks at the rear of Colt Island, where he took his first
giant stride on his way to the mainland.</p>
<p><b>Getting there</b></p>
<p>If you want to visit this cache using public transport, the bus
route to take from Dublin City centre is the No. 33 which will drop
you off at Skerries,Alternatively, you can take the 41 from Dublin
City Centre to Swords, and then take the 33A<br />
 (which from Swords on follows the same route as the 33).</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p><font color="green">In order to claim this cache you will need
to do the following :</font></p>
<p><b><font color="red">You will need to bring a camera to take a
photo of you and your Gps at the Second location in order to claim
a find for this cache.<br />
Logs without photo's will not be deleted due to the recent changes
from groundspeak.however a photo will prove you didn't take any
short cuts to your caching peers :-)</font></b></p>
<p>In order to find the coordinates for each location you will
first need to brush up on your calculus: we have constructed three
equations for you and for each stage we will ask you to solve a
standard problem related to these equations to get the next
coordinates. We have also provided a plot for each equation, but
these are there only to illustrate the problem that needs to be
solved.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> At the First location you will need to find Paddies
Goat and take note of the date inscribed on it, call this date
<b>ABCD</b> <i>(Note: This will also be used for the final
location, so keep it safe!)</i></p>
<p>To find the location for the second part of the cache you should
look at the following linear equation:</p>
<p><b>y = Q.A3QR36x - S.5T</b></p>
<p>Where Q = D - B, R = (D - A) / 4, S = C / 2, T = C - A</p>
<p>To get the North coordinates for stage 2 you need to find the
point where the line intersects the x-axis <i>(marked as (X2,Y2) in
the image)</i> and take the x-coordinate from that <i>(i.e. X2 in
the image)</i>. Round the number you get to 3 decimal places to get
something of the form aa.bbb and the first half of your next
coordinates is <b>N53 aa.bbb</b></p>
<p>To get the West coordinates you need to find the point where the
line intersects the y-axis and use its y-coordinate <i>(i.e. use Y1
of point (X1,-Y1))</i>, round this to 3 decimal places to get
cc.ddd and your next West coordinate is <b>W006 cc.ddd</b></p>
<p>
<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8522a233-d25d-49fa-ab4c-8e2c603fe08e.jpg" />
</p>
<p><b>2.</b> At the second location you will find the information
needed for the third location of this cache, no equation for this
one!. <b><font color="green">(Don't forget to take your photo of
the area in order to claim a find)</font></b></p>
<p><b>3.</b> At the third location obtain the date on the wall and
call this <b>EFGH</b></p>
<p>To get the coordinates for the fourth location you need to look
at the following equation:</p>
<p><b>y = Ux<sup>2</sup> - V6.6FHx - HHG.GFE6</b></p>
<p>Where U = G - E and V = E + H</p>
<p>When plotting this equation you will get a parabola. This
parabola intersects the x-axis at two different points: (-X1,Y1)
and (X2,Y2). Round both x-coordinates to 3 decimal places to get X1
= aa.bbb and X2 = cc.ddd and the coordinates for stage 4 are <b>N53
cc.ddd W006 aa.bbb</b></p>
<p>
<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/e7ad6aa2-60b8-4bb4-9dfc-c2c51df71abb.jpg" />
</p>
<p><b>4.</b> At the fourth location obtain the date of the floral
competition and call this <b>IJKL</b>.Also note the date when the
president of Ireland visited the site and call this date
<b>MNOP</b>.</p>
<p>The coordinates for this location can be got from the following
equation:</p>
<p><b>y = 2x<sup>3</sup> + CL.LNHx<sup>2</sup> - I2BL.2GCG2x +
G.H5</b></p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Instead of looking at intersections with the axis, we will now
consider the maximum and minimum of this equation. The maximum is
marked in the image as (-X1,Y1) and the minimum is marked as
(X2,-Y2). Find the x-coordinates of these points and round them to
3 decimal places to get X1 = aa.bbb and X2 = cc.ddd. The
coordinates for the final information of this cache are then <b>N53
aa.bbb W006 cc.ddd</b>.</p>
