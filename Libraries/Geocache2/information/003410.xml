  <long-description>Sidetracked-Castleknock

Easy cache and dash, located at the train station of the wealthy suburb of Castleknock on the Western Line. House prices in this area reached almost laughable telephone number figures during the recent now equally laughable Celtic Tiger.
The entrance to the station is at a bridge over the railway line which marks the mythical local border between Blanchardstown and Castleknock. It is thought that if you live in the suburban area to the south of this bridge then you are from "real" Castleknock which added zeros to your property. Those to the north are considered residents of Blanchardstown.

Castleknock is a railway station in Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, Ireland.The station opened on 2 July 1990.[1]

It lies on the Dublin to Longford commuter route and is served by Western Commuter services from Pearse Station to Maynooth and Docklands to Clonsilla.

The station has two through platforms. It originally featured a portacabin booking office, however a permanent station building was constructed (and the platforms lengthened) as part of the upgrade of the Western Commuter service in 2000.</long-description>

We couldn't find this one, I searched for ages and couldn't turn anything up, finally gave up and himself went to look, and he couldn't find it either - divine retribution for his quick find at Coolmine maybe! We scratched our heads over the hint, and could find nothing to explain that either.
