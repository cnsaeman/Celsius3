<p>It is well worth a visit inside. The interior is crammed with
antiques and memorabilia from days gone by. You can look around at
your leisure or the guide can give you a tour around, showing you
how some of the treasures work!</p>
<p>The walk up to the tower, from Abbey St., is brief but
steep.</p>
<p>The cache is a micro, containing the log only, so bring your own
pen and <b>PLEASE</b> replace the cache exactly were you found
it.</p></long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

After eating an ice cream near the harbour, we went to find the cache.
Nice view over there.

Thanks for this one...
