  <long-description><p>St. Stephen's Church, also known as The Pepper Canister Church
or the Pepper Pot Church was the last of a series of Georgian
Churches built by the Church of Ireland. This "Gem of Dublin" is
situated on Mount Street Crescent and is well worth a visit.</p>
<p><br />
St. Stephen's holds concerts and events in which world wide acts,
mainly choirs and bands, perform in front of an in house
audience.</p>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

On our way back to the hotel, this was the last cache today. The hint was very helpful.

Thanks for this one...
