<br />
A shortish, if boggy stroll in the Garden County which takes in the
North and South Tonduffs and for good measure, the source of
Dublin's River Liffey and that of the River Dargle. The walk, at
its max (using the route illustrated above which you are not
obliged to do to reach the cache), is approx 8K with a total
incline of 260m, most of which is negotiating small peat hags and
some rough and lumpy open terrain.<br />
<br />
There is room for one or two cars at Stage 1 at N53 09.818 W006
17.719. Here you will find a small sign with information on the
front and back of it. On the back (or Tonduff) side you will find a
small declaration given in English and in Irish. Leaving out the
small writing at the bottom count all the LETTERS in the Irish
section, call this AB. Now take the fourth line of the poem above
and count the WORDS in it, call this CD.<br />
<br />
The final cache is close to the summit of Tonduff North at N53
09.(AB X CD) -9 W006 16.(AB X 3) -10<br />
<br />
For those interested in a pleasant and interesting circular hike,
if you set off in the direction of the cairn that is visible to the
south rather than directly toward the cache, you will very shortly
meet the actual source of the River Liffey at N53 09.495 W006
16.245. At most times a small pond marks the spot.<br />
Carrying on to that cairn at N53 09.165 W006 17.585 you will be
quite close to Crockan Pond (N53 09.025 W006 17.835). From there
you can head in an easterly direction for about 2K and you will
cross a small stream which is the source of the River Dargle. This
is at N53 09.025 W006 16.245.<br />
From there it is a relatively easy uphill hike north to Tonduff
South first then on to the cache on Tonduff north.<br />
It is worth noting this route as it is not only more interesting
but it also provides the gentlest means of approaching the final
cache though it is longer than the more direct route. While
ascending towards Tonduff North it is easiest by far to approach
via Tonduff South and my route achieves this.<br />
You may notice plenty of larksong along the way which means you
will probably be very close to their nesting sites and they will be
letting you know!!<br />

I really like these "guided tours" of the Wicklow Mountains, especially the summits I haven't visited before. I couldn't find a way to park at the start co-ordinates that didn't block the gateway, so I parked a little way up the road. At every parking place there was the ominous sight of broken window-glass. [:(!] Set off following the instructions up to the cairn (actually it seems to be the remains of a house - what a strange place to build a house!) and from there to the Pond that forms the head of the Cloghoge River that feeds Lough Tay. The co-ordinates for the Liffey Pot were wrong, which was a bit confusing. The real co-ordinates are approx N53 09.484 W6 17.540. Interesting to see the pool where the river starts. Lots of deer between there and the start of the Dargle. From there I departed from the plan, making a detour to the intermediate summit between Tonduff and Maulin, and then back to the top of Tonduff. Hard to see why Tonduff is marked as "north" and "south" on the map. There don't seem to be two distinct summits. Found the cache easily and dropped in a bug. Thanks for another interesting Walk in the Garden!</li><li>2010-04-12T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />FTF. 
Pleasant walk, but not quite so easy as I took the direct route. I would suggest anyone doing this to do the circular route on the cache page, as it's probably a lot more pleasant. 
Nice views from the cache site, and quiet! On a weekend you can hear cars or planes but today there was only birdsong while I was signing the log.</li><li>2010-04-01T21:08:30Z : Publish Listing by Croaghan <br />Published</li></ul></logs>
