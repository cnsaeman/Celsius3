  <long-description><p>Oldtown is a good example of a ‘chapel village’ which lead to a
widespread investment in chapel building following the re-emergence
of institutional Catholicism in the late eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The original chapel, which was built in 1827, became the focal
point of the village and attracted a range of other services such
as the national school, community hall, priest’s house, shop,
public house and forge. The term ‘chapel villages’ has been coined
for settlements, which evolved in association with the growing
social and cultural importance of the Catholic Church in Irish
society.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Gazette of Ireland 1843-44 states that the
population of Oldtown in 1841 was 156 and 27 houses were located
within the village area of 10 acres. After the Great Famine of 1848
the census of 1851 states the population of the village as recorded
as 32 people.</p>
<p>Molly Weston a heroine of the 1798 rebellion was born near
Oldtown. She fought alongside her three brothers at Tara. A
memorial was erected to her memory at Oldtown during the 1798
Bi-Centennial in 1998.</p>
<p>Another local celebrity and honorary mascot is a donkey rumoured
to be in excess of 80 years of age. Nicknamed Pico by an American
visitor to the village in October of 2005, his age is as yet
unverified.</p>
<p>Oldtown was the first town in the State to benefit from the
Rural Electrification Scheme, run by the Electricity Supply Board
from 1946 to 1979. The first electricity pole was ceremoniously
erected in November, 1946 at Kilsallaghan, and the first switch-on,
was in Oldtown itself, in January 1947. The 50thanniversary of the
event was commemorated in the village, by the ESB hosting a dinner,
to which families living in the area since 1946, were invited.</p>
<p>More recently in the winter of 1981/1982 a large snowstorm cut
off the village for 5 days, eventually the Air Corps had to fly in
supplies such as food and medicine via helicopter to relieve the
village.</p>

Serapis.</li><li>2009-07-19T19:00:00Z : Found it by abra123cadabra <br />With the weather being kind to us for a while we headed up to Oldtown to do this multi. Stage 1 and 2 where easily found but at stage 3 the GPSr indicated GZ+1m at a potential hiding place. Alas, we couldn't find anything here. Then the other half said if he were to hide something, he'd put it at that other much more impressive location and should we have a look there? Went over with the GPSr in hand and low and behold it again went to GZ+1m. Of course the box was there.

This cache was number five today. We made our way to the first stage without any trouble, but on our way to the second we had to run for cover as the heavens opened up on us. While we hid under a tree we did the maths to solve the final co-ords and then dashed back to the car once the rain had lightened off.

The final location was a nice spot, if a little hard to park at. We drove past the cache site twice wondering were we could park, then Abbey decided 'to hell with it' & drove her car up to the small area to the front of the cache site, trying not to think about how she was going to reverse back down onto the small windy road [xx(]. We had a little stroll around the site  and found the cache easily. We loved the place the cache was hidden [^]
The cache was big enough to drop a coin in to and we left the TB that was in it, as we have seen it before.
