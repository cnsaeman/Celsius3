  <description><b>Cache Description</b> 
<p>The cache container is a black decontamination container. It is
hidden near a prehistoric wedge-tomb on the northern slopes of
Kilmashogue Mountain, adjacent to the Wicklow Way and convenient to
a car-park. Unfortunately the approach to the cache location is
steep and is not suitable for wheelchairs or buggies. <i>The cache
is not in the precincts of the monument. You will not need to
interfere with the monument to find the cache.</i></p></description>
  <long-description><b>Access</b> 
<p><i>Car/Cycle</i> Approaching along College Road from
Dundrum/Sandyford, or Whitechurch Road from Rathfarnham, pass under
the M50 at Kilmashogue Bridge. A left turn at the roundabout will
take you up Kilmashogue Lane. After 1 km turn left and enter the
car park.</p>
<p><i>Public Transport</i> Unfortunately this location is not
easily accessible by public transport. The most attractive option
is to take Dublin Bus <a rel="nofollow"
href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/your_journey/viewer.asp?route=16">route
16</a> to the gate of Marlay Park, and follow the waymarked
<a rel="nofollow"
href="http://www.wicklowway.com/wicklow_way_trail/index.shtml">Wicklow
Way</a> through the park and up to the cache location.
Alternatively, <a rel="nofollow"
href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/your_journey/viewer.asp?route=15c">route
15C</a> terminates in Whitechurch. Either way, you will have to
walk around 2.5 km to the cache.</p>
<p><b>Description of the Monument</b></p>
<p>This gallery grave was built by Neolithic farmers around 4000
years ago. It went unrecorded until 1950, when the then landowner
reported it to the Inspector of National Monuments. Its importance
was immediately realised and the site was excavated.</p>
<p>Gallery graves were constructed by raising rows of upright
stones and laying roof-slabs across the top to form a covered
passage-way. Along the passage-way were burial chambers. In this
example, the plan seems to consist of an antechamber, a large main
chamber, and possibly a smaller chamber to the rear.</p>
<p>The whole structure was once topped with a cairn of rocks and
soil, retained by a ring of kerb-stones. The cairn and roof-slabs
have been plundered for building materials, leaving the uprights,
gallery floor and kerb stones exposed, as well as a sill-stone at
the entrance of the main chamber.</p>
<p>In cases such as this where the gallery is wider and taller at
the entrance than at the rear, the structure is known as a "wedge
tomb". This is one of 3 wedge tombs in the Barony of Rathdown, the
other two being Ballyedmonduff on the east slope of Two Rock
Mountain and Laughanstown adjacent to Junction 16
(Loughlinstown/Shankill) on the M50.</p>
<p>Characteristic features of a wedge tomb include "double-lined"
or in this case "triple-lined" walls, where the side walls of the
gallery consist of two or three rows of stones.</p>
<p>A later addition to the site was the insertion of Bronze Age
burial "cists" (stone boxes) into the cairn. These are still
visible, and during the excavation yielded funerary urns, bones and
pottery. No artefacts or remains connected with the original
Neolithic monument were found.</p>
