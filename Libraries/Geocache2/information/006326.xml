  <description>I have now found about 50 caches in Ireland. This is my contribution to the Irish caching community.</description>
  <long-description>Although usually referred to as Portobello Bridge, the correct name is La Touche Bridge (named after William Digges La Touche (1747-1803), scion of a prominent Dublin business family and a director of the Grand Canal Company).
Like the Portobello area of London, Dublin’s Portobello was ultimately named for the capture by Admiral Vernon in 1739 of Portobelo, Colón on Panama’s Caribbean Coast.
The name Portobello describes the stretch of the Grand Canal leading from Robert Emmet Bridge (Clanbrassil Street) to the bridge from South Richmond Street to Rathmines.

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Founded at night, on our way back to the hotel. Interesting devices.

Thanks for this one...
