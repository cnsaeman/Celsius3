<br />
 Located on Sean Mac Dermott Street, this architectural leftover is
a pitiful sight. This once fine building, a Protestant Church in
the Greek revival style, dates from the 1850s, and was designed by
a Scottish architect called Ferguson. Today, all that is left of
the structure is a lonely facade, with the remainder of the
building having been destroyed by fire in the 1980s. <br />
<br />
Today the facade stands in stark contrast to the bland functional
buildings that surround it. Little attempt to highlight the
building, or restore any part of it, appears to have been made. In
a more upmarket neighbourhood there would undoubtedly have been a
campaign to restore the building, but alas, here it is left
untouched. <br />
<br />
Note: This street and many of it's surrounding neighbours have
something of a bad reputation. While this may well be exaggerated
somewhat, it is nonetheless advisable to keep your wits about you
and hide any obvious valuables. I would be reluctant to seek this
cache after dark! <br />
<br />
The cache is a magnetic micro. Please replace it exactly as you
found it, making sure it is not visible. Enjoy!</long-description>

After our boating holydays on the beautiful River Shannon we spent a few days in Dublin.

I explored this interesting lively city on foot and visited some caches. I found this one without any problems.

Attention: The log book is wet.

Thank you for this nice cache and greetings from Germany.

For obvious reasons, did not sign log.</li><li>2010-05-22T20:13:21Z : Temporarily Disable Listing by Bootle <br />needs to be replaced</li><li>2010-05-22T16:44:52Z : Needs Maintenance by GudrunXY <br />see log</li><li>2007-09-12T07:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Found this one while out with CMB50.
