SL TFTC</li><li>2010-04-18T19:00:00Z : Found it by dsquaredd2 <br />Lots of grounded birds, none moving. Very sad for one trying to get home. Fourth and last of a long (about 5 mile round trip) to grab several caches surrounding the airport. Starting in sunshine, ending in darkness. This is when I realized I had to go back the way I came, bummer. TFTC!</li><li>2010-04-06T19:00:00Z : Found it by Sean O'Neill <br />17:32 Hrs,#1693.

TFTC</li><li>2010-04-01T19:00:00Z : Found it by Moonshiner Extraordinaire <br />I had tried to find this cache twice before – I didn’t even get to the co-ordinates on 09/02/2009 (note) and a DNF on 23/05/2009 (cache was gone). Today was a bit of an anti-climax – I parked just a few metres away, walked to GPS ‘0’, looked – and there it was. Found at 15:55, just 1 metre from ‘0’. Back to the car to sign the log – then had to wait for a muggle-free moment (that’s a busy road) to replace the cache. Gazillions of Aer Lingus planes came and went. Go raibh maith agat faoi’n taisce.
