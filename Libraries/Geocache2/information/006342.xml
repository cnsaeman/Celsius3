  <long-description>The cache is a small cylindrical container which is hidden in a
small park next to Mount Argus church. The top screws off so please
be careful with it and be sure to tighten it before leaving. Please
also ensure that the rubber seal remains intact.<br>
 The river Poddle runs through this tiny park.<br>
 The Stone Boat, not to be confused with the local pub of the same
name, was constructed in the river in the early part of the last
century. There is not much left of it now but I have included a
couple of pictures.<br>
 Mount Argus church itself is also worth a look. When I was a child
growing up here this huge church would be packed at every Mass each
Sunday. People used to have to huddle outside in the large space in
front of the entrance. The Passionist Order who inhabit the large
building to the left of the church used to own large tracts of land
all around the church but they obviously relented to the pressures
of development and sold off much of it for housing, hence our
little park.<br>
In the fifties there used to be a paint factory just up river of
this section and often the river would run with all the colours of
the rainbow, in less strictly controlled times. As kids, we would
all be as high as kites on the fumes, decades before "glue
sniffing" became the thing.<br>
I grew up just above the factory and the river meandered through
green fields. I spent much of my childhood along the river in swim
holes during summer and fishing for minnows, pinkeens and tadpoles
or chasing frogs. I spent hours mesmerised by the diving antics of
feeding kingfishers, naively convinced they picked up their
beautiful colours from the paint factory.<br>
I am told they now thrive above and below the area of the Stone
Boat so I would be pleased to hear reports of any sightings by
geocachers.</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-23T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by THE_Chris <br />No luck for me either :( Lovely park just couldnt find the cache. Didnt even know where to begin looking! And given the hot weather there were thousands (literally) of bitey flies going up and down the river in some sort of major 'fly highway'. Didnt want to get eaten alive so left it. Saw a robin eating flies and a very energetic coal tit bathing though.

I'll be back!!</li><li>2010-05-04T19:00:00Z : Owner Maintenance by Kili or bust <br />Don't particuarly enjoy going out to replace a log when it doesn't really need it! There was room for about another 20 logs though people could have been a tiny bit more sparing with some of their scrawls and comments.
I put in a new water resistant one anyway.</li><li>2010-04-26T20:04:24Z : Needs Maintenance by Ravenheart <br />Logbook is full.  New logbook needed.</li><li>2010-04-26T19:00:00Z : Found it by Ravenheart <br />Second time to this cache.  Found it with the help of daylight this time.TFTC</li><li>2010-02-16T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by slands <br />No luck finding this one at lunchtime today. I tried using the hint, but it just took me to an area where there were lots of bottles and cans thrown around the place....definitely not somewhere I would want to search for a cache. 

When I got home and checked the spoiler photo I realise I must have been off a bit, as I did not see the item in the spoiler while searching. Will try to get back another day.....

Stephen...</li><li>2008-08-28T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />How old was he? I honestly have no clue! Still, that looks a likely place and after a bit of hunting and sending in the boy we had it in hand. TFTC</li></ul></logs>
