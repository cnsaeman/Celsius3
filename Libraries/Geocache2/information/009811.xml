Located off Pearse Street in Dublin's city centre, Pearse Square
offers a pleasant break from the hustle and bustle of the many busy
streets nearby. The Square is a rectangular open space of just over
0.5 hectare, overlooked by houses on three sides and with the
fourth side opening onto Pearse Street. The square was formerly
known as Queen Square and dates from 1839. In 1996, the Parks
Division commenced a 2-year refurbishment programme, the design
concept taking as its basis a formal layout which was noted on the
1838 Ordnance Survey map for the area. <br />
<br />
A 3.5 metre-high contemporary bronze sculpture entitled "Harmony"
by Sandra Bell forms the Square's centrepiece and the park was
re-opened to the public on 2nd July 1998. <br />
<br />
On a fine day the locals are playing football, shooting the breeze,
or simply sitting on the steps outside their lovely Georgian homes.
Pop in to the park and rest your feet! <br />
<br />
The cache is a micro/small traditional cache. Please replace it as
you found it, ensuring it is not visible. Beware of possible
watching eyes in this residential area. Enjoy <br />
