  <long-description>Cache info:<br>
Part 1 is situated close to a former home of the writer and Nobel
Prize winner Samuel Beckett and very close to Leixlip town (Leim an
Bhradain or Salmon Leap)which is now really a suburb of greater
Dublin but it is actually in County Kildare. There you will have to
retrieve a small container with the coordinates for the final
cache. Please be sure to leave the coordinates there when you get
them. Be sure to bring pen and paper for the purpose.<br>

SAMUEL BECKETT<br>
<br>
Novelist, poet, dramatist. Nobel Prize for Literature (1969)
Beckett was born in Foxrock, a prosperous area of Dublin. He
attended Portora Royal School in Enniskillen where Oscar Wilde had
attended before him. There he excelled at playing cricket, rugby
and at boxing. He went to college at Trinity College Dublin where
he briefly taught French.<br>
 Having become a trusted friend of James Joyce, whom he met in
Paris, he settled there from 1937 until 1942. On one occasion, in
1938, he was stabbed in the street by a local pimp. A passing
student, Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil, helped him and called an
ambulance. The close relationship which started then survived
service together in the French wartime Resistance, their betrayal
to the Gestapo, and their escape together. They were married at
last, in 1961, and Beckett outlived Suzanne by less than a
year.<br>
 Beckett experimented with writing poetry and drama from the 1920s.
His first novel to be published, in 1938, was Murphy. After his
next novel, Watt, finished in 1946, he turned to writing primarily
in French ("the better to write without a style" he commented), and
later translating his works into English.<br>
The great period of work which won him the Nobel Prize began with
the trilogy of novels Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnameable,
finished in 1950. The play En Attendant Godot, translated by
himself as Waiting for Godot, won him worldwide fame and notoriety
for its unconventional blending of comedy and despair, after the
first production in 1953. He followed these successes with many
others, written in an increasingly spare style, paring down the
text to its barest essentials. Apart from novels and plays, he
composed original work for radio, television, and film, and was
still adding to a series of enigmatic prose texts even in his last
few years.<br>
