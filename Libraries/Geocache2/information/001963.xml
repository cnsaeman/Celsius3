  <long-description><p>There are many great Irish religious relics, but the most famous
and memorable one of them all was ‘An Bachall Iosa’ or The Jesus
Staff. The faithful believed that Jesus appeared to St Patrick and
handed him the staff on an island in the Mediterranean, before he
began his mission in Ireland.</p>
<p>In the Annals of Ulster and the Four Masters, both mention that
it was a symbol of Patrick’s authority here. St. Bernard of
Clairvaux described it as ‘covered with gold and adorned with the
most costly gems’.</p>

<p>It was then in the possession of the visiting St. Malachy,
Archbishop of Armagh who had had to purchase it from Niall, the
usurping lay-primate before he could take up his See. When disputes
broke out among Irish chieftains, treaties of peace were made and
signed over it and solemn vows taken in its presence. It was
originally held in Armagh but during the eleventh century it was
brought to Ballyboghill, north of Dublin.</p>
<p>The tradition in the district is to the effect that this
venerated relic was for a number of years preserved in the old
church of Ballyboghill - which has been for a number of years in
ruins</p>
