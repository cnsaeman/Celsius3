  <long-description><b>"Dublin's Stadia Sweries 1 - The National Basketball Arena "</b>

<br />
The series consists of:<br />
<br />
<table>
<tr>
<td>Croke Park <i>Gaelic Football & Hurling</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Aviva Stadium <i>Soccer & Rugby</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The RDS Ballsbridge <i>Show Jumping</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>

</table>

<br />
The series will bring you to stadia, both old and new, of Dublin
city and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the love of
all sport that is alive, not only in this city, but in the country
in general. The various venues are of different ages and sizes.
They are impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities.<br />

<b>The National Basketball Arena</b> was opened in January 1993. It
is one of five identical buildings worldwide designed by the
American architect Dan Tully. It is strategically located at the
intersection of the Western Parkway, M50 and the Tallaght By-Pass,
Dublin, and its unusual design makes it stand out, while
overlooking the M50 motorway.<br />
<br />
The Arena is Ireland's premier indoor sports facility with
permanent seating for 2,100 and 18,000 sq ft of floor space. It was
designed for all sporting activities, not just basketball.<br />
<br />
It is the home of the Irish Basketball Association (IBA) and hosts
all home ESB Super League fixtures for its resident team, Shamrock
Rovers Hoops.<br />

<p style="text-align:left">Sport is not the only purpose of the
arena: throughout the year the arena hosts events such as
exhibitions, conferences, trade shows, banquets, exams and
concerts.</p>

on your timing, and please replace the cache exactly as you found
