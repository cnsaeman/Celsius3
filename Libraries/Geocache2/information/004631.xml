  <long-description><p>The well is situated on the left-hand side of this ancient
graveyard. It looks like a miniature church and steps lead down to
the well.<br />
 This is a very special well, frequently visited in the
past,ledgend has it that it will cure all your worries, but
unfortunately there is very little water in it today and it looks
as if the outlet drain into a stream close by could be blocked.
Alternatively, it could be ?offended? because most of the local
people appear to have forgotten it exists.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>To find the cache you need to take note of how many steps lead
down into the well call the answer A<br />
Note how many leaves appear on the step call this B<br />
 look for a nearby grave maker that mentions "Nags Head" &
"hill CD"</p>
<p>The cache can be found at N53 32.(A+B)0C W6 19.(C+D)8A</p>
<p>The cache is a micro container please rehide it carefully to
prevent muggles from finding it</p>

I had been previously, several months back, and had worked out the final location only to find a car pulling up right at the spot. An elderly gentleman had come to tend a grave and was in and out to the car constantly. I decided not to hang around and to come back another day.

Go raibh maith agat as an taisce.</li><li>2009-09-21T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Serapis <br />I was on a roll this afternoon as I made my way towards Co Louth and taking in a few caches, mostly multi’s. This is where my luck ran out. I pulled up near a white van which was also parked by the graveyard, the driver seemed to be taking a rest. I headed into the graveyard to seek out the well which I found almost straight away. Things seemed straightforward but for the number of steps question, for me, this was defiantly a bit suspect. 

I initially plugged in one number which appeared to be obvious, so much so, that I headed off to the co ords that the equation predicted. After a hundred metres or so I decided this was wrong, so I plugged in the next obvious number – this was even worse. I decided to go to the next number which didn’t at all seem to be right but gave me co ords which seemed to be ‘more like it’. As it turned out they were back toward my car and were right where the white van was parked. I sat in and decided to wait for him to move. This took a while as he was having a nap.

After twenty or so minutes he started up and headed off – nice one I thought and as I got out of my car a little micra nipped in to the exact spot the van had occupied. Oh Flip. An old man who was poorly on his feet eventually got out, locked the car, shuffled off and proceeded to tend the grave right inside the wall where I was planning on concentrating my search. He did move on a bit and I got a chance to do a quick search but it yielded nil. He appeared back around after a while and we exchanged pleasantries. He went back to tending the grave. I went to the Naul.

Will be back soon. Serapis.
