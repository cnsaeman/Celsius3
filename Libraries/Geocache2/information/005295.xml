<p>The Folly was built within Castletown Estate commissioned by
Katherine Conolly, the philanthropic widow of Speaker William
Conolly to provide employment for hundreds of the poor of Celbridge
when the famine of 1740-41 was at its worst. The Obelisk was built
in 1740 after a particularly severe winter. As a folly, it could be
seen from the back of Castletown some 2.5 miles (4 km) away.
Designed by Richard Castle, it is 42 metres (140 feet) high and is
composed of several arches, adorned by stone pineapples and eagles,
topped by a massive obelisk pillar. It was restored in 1965 by the
Irish Georgian Society, and nearby is the grave of Mariga, first
wife of the Hon.Desmond Guinness of Leixlip Castle. It is currently
undergoing restoration so beware of muggles...</p>
<p><b>The cache is a medium size loc-box wrapped in a black
covering.</b></p>

TFTC </li><li>2010-03-08T20:00:00Z : Found it by Moonshiner Extraordinaire <br />Fresh from my FTF find at ‘Leixlip Gate’, I made my way here, parking just at the entry to the folly. It was nice to see restoration work taking place on it. I had been here many years ago (1983) with my wife to be and Stargazer. Being energetic in that era, I climbed to the ‘top’ (as high as one could get), accompanied by Stargazer. I think if I’m back here after the work is complete, I’ll just admire it from ground level… There was just one man working up on the scaffolding & when his back was turned, I scooped up the cache. Quickly & easily found (at 15:44, just 2 metres from ‘0’). Once again, I was impressed by the beautiful stitching on the black covering. Delighted (but not surprised this time) to be FTF again. I brought the cache to the car to examine, took the FTF certificate – and then, when the workman was working, I deftly replaced the cache. Back at the car again, I saw ‘something’ that should have been in the cache… I had to repeat the whole operation… Before leaving, I went in and had a nice chat with the workman – who gave me the whole history (even though I knew it). I told him about a set of stone steps behind the folly, probably leading back to the big house. He didn’t know about them and said he’d check it out. Happy with myself, I went off to do some work in the area and headed home. Go raibh maith agaibh faoi’n taisce san áit seo.
