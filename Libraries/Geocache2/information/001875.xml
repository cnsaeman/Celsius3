  <long-description><p align="justify">"Sword in the Stone" is a famous part of King
Arthur's Legend. Arthur was the first son of King Uther Pendragon.
He was heir to the throne, but these were very troublous times and
magician Merlin decided to hide him in a secret place. When King
Uther died, a big rivalry about his throne started. Merlin using
his magic set sword in the stone (in other version anvil). On this
sword there was a golden inscription: "Whoso pulleth out this sword
of this stone is the rightwise born king of all England". Many
people tried to pull it out but without success. Finally, Arthur
manage to withdraw the sword and after that he became king.</p>
