  <long-description><p><b>The Castle</b></p>
<p>Although referred to as a Castle, the residence at Ardgillan is
a large country-style house with castellated embellishments.
Originally named "Prospect", the central section was built in 1738
by Robert Taylor, with the west and east wings added in the late
1700's.<br />
Initially the site was heavily wooded, the name Ardgillan being
derived from the Irish "Ard Choill" meaning High Wood. It was
cleared by out-of-service soldiers and itinerant workers in return
for one penny a day, sleeping accommodation and one meal.<br />
The house consists of two storey’s over a basement which extends
out under the lawns on the southern side of the building. When
occupied, the ground and first floors were the living accommodation
while the west and east wings were servant’s quarters and estate
offices. The basement was the service floor, the kitchen and
stores. The castle has now been restored and the ground floor rooms
and kitchens are open to visitors for guided tours. Tea-rooms are
located off the main reception area and serving light snacks are
open in conjunction with the Castle opening times. Upstairs, the
former bedrooms are used for classes and exhibitions including a
permanent and unique exhibition of the "Down Survey" color maps and
text. Rooms are also available form small group meetings and
workshops.</p>
<p><b>Ardgillan Today</b></p>
<p>Ardgillan was opened to the public as a Regional Park in June
1985. Preliminary works were carried out prior to the opening in
order to transform what had been an arable farm, into a public
park. Five miles of footpaths were provided throughout the demesne,
some by opening old avenues, while others were newly constructed.
They now provide a system of varied and interesting woodland walks,
and vantage points from which to enjoy views of the sea and
coastline.</p>
<p><b>The Gardens</b></p>
<p>The gardens are in two main parts, the formal garden to the west
of the house and the walled garden to the north west. In 1983 work
began on the replanting of the formal garden using the layout of
the Ordnance Survey map of 1865. A wide collection of roses have
been planted, from species and old varieties around the perimeter,
climbing roses on the pergola and 'Hybrid Ts' and 'Floribundas' in
the centre beds.<br />
 The final stage of the development of the Rose garden was the
rebuilding of the Victoria conservatory, constructed by the
Scottish firm 'McKenzie an Moncur' in the 1880's for the Jameson of
'Seamount', Malahide. When fully completed this will incorporate a
Museum of Garden History with access from the Walled Garden. This
very fine glasshouse was donated to the Parks Department by Mr
& Mrs. Tracey, the present owners of 'Seamount'.<br />
The walled garden was originally a Victorian styled kitchen garden,
used to supply the fruit, vegetables and cut flower requirements of
Ardgillan House. It is 2 acres in size, and subdivided into five
separate compartments, each having a different theme; a Herb
garden, using herbs suitable to culinary, medicinal, dyeing and
pot-pourii, as well as a number of plants specifically for bees and
butterflies; a vegetable pottager, demonstrating the variety of
vegetables that can be grown in a small area and yet look
attractive.<br />
The 'Irish Garden' is constantly increasing its collection of
plants of Irish origin, whether native species or varieties, or
plants named after Irish collectors. This section also includes a
most unusual free-standing 'Fruit Wall' with twenty alcoves used
for growing the more tender fruit such as peaches, nectarines,
pears etc. Another section includes a 'Four Seasons' garden showing
the variety of plants that either flower, fruit or have ornamental
bark in a particular season. The final section will demonstrate the
wide range of semi-tender plants that can survive outdoors for many
years as well as a range of fruit plants of Irish origin.</p>
<p>A coffee shop is open in the former Head Steward's house
adjoining the Castle. The opening hours are displayed on the notice
board.<br />
 Guided tours of the Gardens are available during the months of
June / July / August at 3.30pm on Thursday afternoons or by special
arrangement for groups.</p>
<p><b>The Yew Walk</b></p>
<p>One surviving feature still intact in the garden is the Yew Walk
which lies to the south of the house and is seen as one approaches
from the entrance at Black hills. This was planted in 1800's during
the lifetime of Marianne Taylor, wife of Rev. Henry Edward Taylor.
It was the favorite walk of Captain Edward Taylour (1863 - 1938).
Local folklore has it that a shadowy figure sometimes seen here is
the ghost of a member of the Taylour family.</p>

<p>While site works were proceeding an underground passage was
discovered, which turned out to be the long-lost Ice House, the
precursor of the modern day refrigerator. In winter ice would have
been collected from frozen lakes and rivers and packed into the
chamber so as to provide a cold store for meat, dairy products,
wines plus other perishable commodities to be used later in the
year.</p>
