Cache info:<br />
Like most of the Liffey Bridge caches this is a magnetic micro and
can be found without accurate coordinates though it may take a
while. The coordinates above only take you to the general area. If
you do need better coordinates then add the number of lanterns on
one side of the bridge to get “A” and add the number of busts in
relief on the Sunlight Chambers building under the depictions
described below to form “B”.<br />
Please also bear in mind that the accuracy of your GPSr could be
affected by the amount of metal on the bridge so this may take a
bit of a search, hence the 2 star rating.<br />
<br />
The coordinates will then be N53 20.752+A W006 16.076-B<br />
<br />

Grattan Bridge or Capel St Bridge<br />
<br />
<br />
Named after Henry Grattan MP (1746-1820) and opened in 1874. The
original bridge on this site was built in 1676 and called Essex
Bridge after the Lord Lieutenant Arthur Capel, Earl of Essex and
was developed by Sir Humphrey Jervis. Fourteen years later severe
flooding washed away a large part of the bridge so it was
strengthened and repaired. Later in 1722 a statue of George I on
horseback was placed on the bridge - this was removed during
another rebuilding in 1753.<br />
The current bridge has been widened with cast iron supports
extended out from the stonework so as to carry wide pavements on
either side of the roadway. The bridge is lit by ornate lamp
standards also in cast iron. Plans are afoot to add structures to
the pavements to have a book market on the bridge.<br />
 <br />
Note the depictions of life in Ireland in relief on blue background
on the Sunlight Chambers building on the south of the Liffey at the
corner of Essex Quay and Parliament St.<br /></long-description>
