  <long-description><p>The cache is hiden in a small village of Skreen near ruins of an
old church.<br />
 In 875 the shrine and relics of Saint Colmcille were brought for
safe-keeping<br />
to a monastery at this site. Originally known as Achall, the
present name Skreen<br />
 derives from Scrin Choluim Chille - Colmcille’s shrine. The
monastery was plundered<br />
 several times between the late 10th and 12th centuries, and the
shrine<br />
itself was robbed in 1027 but was later recovered. The present
church<br />
may date from the 15th century. It has two sections, as had many
churches<br />
 of the time – a nave where the congregation sat and a
chancel<br />
where the altar was placed. There is a massive tower at its west
end.<br />
 Built into the wall above the south door of the church is a
miniature carving<br />
 of a bishop, probably 14th century, while inside the tower are
fragments<br />
 of a baptismal font and a tomb-slab.<br />
 To the north-east of the church is a late medieval<br />
 stone cross with a Crucifiction on its west face.xz</p>
<br />
<p>The above coordinates are only for reference, you must solve the
puzzle to find the cache.</p>

 <br />
 
<p>Skreen tower stands just opposite to the Hill of Tara on the
other side of N3. You can see one hill from the other very well.
There is a small pitch and put just beside the church. When we came
here for the first time it was possible to borrow the key from the
tower in the small pub beside, but unfortunately it seems they
don't have the key anymore.</p>
