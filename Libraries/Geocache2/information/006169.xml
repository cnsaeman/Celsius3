  <description>This multicache (all stages and the final cache) is located in the
centre of Dublin. It is probably best to attempt finding this cache
walking, the whole route is approximately 2,5 km.</description>
  <long-description><p align="justify">Many people consider swastika an inglorious
symbol of fascism and nazism. But this symbol is much older than
2nd World War and its meaning stands just in opposition to Hitler's
ideology. In many cultures and religions on all continents
(excluding Australia) it is the symbol of the good, happiness,
brightness, life and the sun. In sanskrit &bdquo;svastika&rdquo;
means &bdquo;directing to luck". The oldest known swastika is
12,000 years old! Swastika was most popular in Europe and Asia,
first as a religious symbol, and later as an ornamental sign. It is
still a religious symbol in hinduism, buddism and many ethnic
religions; you can also find it in celtic and old christian
art.</p>

<br />
<p align="justify">Some mystics say, you can't using swastika
against other people, so when Hitler did that, his defeat was
unavoidable.<br />
<br />
The most famous swastika in Dublin was in the logo of a company
&bdquo;Swastika Laundry", established in 1912, and located on
Shelbourne Road, Ballsbridge. They used electric vans for delivery.
This company existed until 1960s (still with swastika in logo!),
when it was bought by another laundry company, and logo was
changed.</p>

<center><i>Swastika Laundry van</i></center>
<br />
<p align="justify">Today you can find some swastikas in
architecture of Dublin if you are looking carefully. Most popular
is the swastika pattern copied from original ancient Greek
ornament.</p>

<br />
<p align="justify">After this short lesson there is time for
finding the cache. But first you need to visit some places with
swastikas and take a note of some information.<br />
<br />
1. First stage is close to the Dublin Spire, at coordinates N
53&deg; 21.002 W 006&deg; 15.557. There is a nice pub with a mosaic
in the front. On both sides of the door you can see vertical
patterns composed of golden swastikas. Above the name of this pub
you would see two words. Sum up all letters in the two words and
call it A.<br />
<br />
2. Now you can go to N 53&deg; 20.922 W 006&deg; 15.572. Above the
windows at 1st floor you can see a horizontal pattern of swastikas.
What is the number of the building? It is a two digit number, call
it BC.<br />
<br />
3. Not far from there, at coordinates N 53&deg; 20.888 W 006&deg;
15.555 there is a building, where a bank is located. Above the main
door there is an arch where you can see a swastika pattern. High,
on the front this building, there is a large name of a previous
bank in this building. There are four words in that name. Count the
number of letters in 2nd word in that name and call it D.
Attention, that name is different than the name of the bank which
is there now!<br />
<br />
4. Next place is another bank building. Stay at coordinates N
53&deg; 20.672 W 006&deg; 15.618 and look up. You would see
patterns of swastikas on the ceiling. How many parallel patterns
can you see on this part (left wing) of the ceiling? Call it E. To
check, subtract 5 from the number of swastikas in one
pattern.<br />
<br />
5. Now, at coordinates N 53&deg; 20.605 W 006&deg; 15.609 you can
find a grey building with small swastikas on the top of the pillars
in the front. Above you should see a date. Call the last two digits
FG.<br />
<br />
6. This is your last step before you find the cache. Go to
coordinates N 53&deg; 20.280 W 006&deg; 15.502 and look up. What
can you see? The sun of course! But not the real one &ndash; on the
ceiling there is a painted sun, and around it there are solar
symbols. One of those is swastika. How many solar symbols (include
swastika) can you see? Call it H.<br />
<br />
7. The final cache is at coordinates:<br />
N 53 FG.EHA W 006 BC.DFG<br />
<br />
The cache is a big tupperware box with some goodies and FTF prize.
High buildings at the preliminary stages and tree cover at the
final location make this cache harder to find. Stage no. 6 and the
final spot are located in areas which are closed in the
evening.<br />

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A lovely day for a spot of multi-clue hunting.

Good to see too that this one is large enough to accept some pretty big TBs if anyone is weighed down by them. TFTC</groundspeak:text>
