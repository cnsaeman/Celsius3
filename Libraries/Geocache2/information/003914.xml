  <long-description>"Weir is the cache" can be found at a weir on the north side of the river Liffey in an area known as the Strawberry Beds in Dublin 15.

Parking is available at The Wren's Nest pub located on the R109, this road is quite busy so take care if walking. 

The weir is a very popular location during sunny days where people come to fish and swim, so beware of muggles.

The cache itself is a small brown lunchbox container placed in some undergrowth. Please take caution when the water levels are high as the area around may become slippery. You do not have to cross the river or enter the water to retrieve the cache.

It is important to note that due to many trees in this area the coordinates can be off slightly.</long-description>

After searching for about an hour, I put away the GPS and used the old grey matter. With a bit of lateral thinking and logic I looked to the left, took a step forward and could just about see the cache while still a few feet away from it. This has been a very satisfying find!

Good one this, we spent about an hour looking before I heard a shout from Besiebob. I thought she has fallen in the river but no!!! she had found the cache.
