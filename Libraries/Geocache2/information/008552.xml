  <description>Dublin&rsquo;s Phoenix Park is a treasure with more than 1700 acres
of walled parkland just 3km from the centre of the city. At 707
hectares (1752 acres) is one of the largest enclosed recreational
spaces within any European capital city.</description>
  <long-description>Few cities have such a facility on their doorsteps &ndash; it is
more than twice as large as Central Park in New York. The park was
for centuries the property of the King&rsquo;s representatives in
Ireland, used as a Royal hunting park &ndash; which is why it was
enclosed by a wall, to keep the game in. However it was opened to
the public in 1747 and so for more than 250 years has been a
favourite playground for generations of Dubliners. The Park is also
home to the Zoological Gardens and Aras an Uachtarain and Victorian
flower gardens. The Phoenix Park is only 1.5 miles from O'Connell
Street. Both passive and active recreational pursuits may be viewed
or pursued such as walking, running, polo, cricket, hurling, etc.
The Glen Pond is set in very scenic surrounds in the Furry Glen.
There are many walks and cycle routes available to the public. The
park is open all year round, there is no admission charge and
visitors can explore freely. Bus Route(s): No's 25, 66 & 67
from city centre.

<p>This is a fine gatelodge to the park, complete with ornate metal
revolving pedestrian gate by J. & C. McGloughlin and unusual
octagonal piers. The house is in a Tudo cottage orné style.</p>
