  <logs><ul><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by abra123cadabra <br />It's not really a DNF, more a "ran out of time" when the thunder and rain gave us the cue to abort our mission and dash for the car. We think we understand the hint and reading more of the previous logs I'm pretty certain we started in the right location. The place is a bit of a tip. I don't understand why people have to dump their old mattresses and whathaveyounot into recreational areas. The cache is also labelled as "kids friendly". Does that apply to the final hiding place? If not, please remove the attribute from the listing. Well, we'll be back to see the container with our own eyes</li><li>2010-04-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by Sookmeister <br />Found it today on a quick stroll with Fibags. Nice dry day so happily stayed clean and dry. A few passers by walking but luckily there were two of us so we were able to look someway natural!!</li><li>2010-02-14T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Blue Jay 59 <br />We were here last Sunday & didn't find it, however did a little research on the hint and was sure we were on the right track- returned today but no luck - escaped us again. 
Very busy spot for muggles, and a lot of rubbish around. Pity [:(] Nice park
