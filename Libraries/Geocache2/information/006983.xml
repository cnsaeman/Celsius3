  <long-description><p>Sals Gap</p>
<p>Sally Gap is the highest crossroads in Ireland. According to one
local legend St. Patrick died here and was taken off to paradise on
a white steed by Ois&iacute;n. Sally Gap comes from "gap in the
saddle" (Bearnas na diallaite in Irish), referring to St.
Patrick&rsquo;s space on the horse behind Ois&iacute;n presumably,
and is nothing to do with the actual shape of the gap or willow
trees. The area around the Sally Gap and Luggala is one of the most
scenic of Wicklow, the Garden County.</p>
<p>There is a rocking stone near the Sally Gap, which Celtic druids
used to determine whether someone was innocent or guilty of a
particular crime. It was a huge big boulder that sat precariously
on top of a smaller stone. The accused would be made lie under it
and if the top stone fell on his head and killed him before he
confessed then he was obviously guilty.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The cache is a decon container please rehide it with care to
prevent the passing muggles from discovering its location.</p>
