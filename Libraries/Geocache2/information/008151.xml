  <long-description><p><b>Stella's Castle</b></p>
<p>The ruins of St Catherine's are to be found near the gates of St
Ita's Hospital. The church dates back to the Norman days. The
church was built in the early 12th century. The lands of Portrane
were granted to Christ Church Cathedral by Sitric the Dane in 1038
A.D. This grant was confirmed by St Laurence O Toole and is
mentioned, among other possessions of Christ Church, by Pope Urban
in 1186. It was once the property of the Nuns of Grace Dieu who are
said to have moved there when their monastery was suppressed (1538)
and they lived at Portrane until the end of the reign of Queen
Elizabeth 1. High up on two sides of the tower can be seen two ugly
faces. This was a very ancient custom from pre-christian times and
was supposed to frighten off evil spirits.</p>
<p>Near the church is a Norman Peel Tower which is often called
"Stella Castle" because it is said that Dean Swift's lady friend,
Stella, lived there for a time in 1712. It is also said that Dean
Swift visited her here.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>The cache is a micro container with note pad and pencil</p>
<p>Please replace it with care to prevent all the young muggles who
frequent this area at night from finding it.</p>
