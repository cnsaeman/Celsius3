  <long-description><p>Start from base of Carrigshouk – park at GR 102052, there are 2
forestry entrances just before the start with a capacity of 2-3
cars each. Get there by way of Sallygap and take the road south
(towards Glendalough). The car parks are approx. 5 miles from
Sallygap. (Alternatively, you can park at GR 113073 and proceed via
Duff Hill).</p>
<p>The route is rough and wet in spots and deserves proper hiking
gear, boots, etc. Head to the right (East)side of Carrigshouk and
work your way up onto the saddle leading to Mullaghcleevaun East
Top.</p>
<p>The cache contains logbook, pencil & sharpener plus: Playing
cards Dinosaur Waterbomb Fair Trade badge (e-mail me for more
details!) Keyring</p></long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-04-19T19:00:00Z : Found it by Spark_ie <br />Yep, the cache is there alright, co-ords spot on for this one too. Again, great views all over from this place, great to see the stretch in the evenings ! TFTC, Spark_ie</li><li>2009-12-28T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Rita666 <br />Hello from Latvia! It was hard to go up there, because there was a lot of snow and cold wind. But I did it! :)) And it was only begining of my diurnal walking through the Wicklow mountains. But I didn't find the cache, because there was a lot of snow and ice. But anyway thanks for the cache!</li><li>2009-09-26T19:00:00Z : Found it by pplsgod <br />Found this cache while out hiking...took a route from Carrigshouk to Mullaghcleevaun, onto Moanbane and Silsean and finally down to Ballynockan. 
Great cache location and as mention above deserves the correct hiking gear. Super views from the cache location but take care if weather is wet as ground is very boggy and slippery in places
TFTC</li><li>2009-04-26T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />Walked here from Duff Hill. Easy enough crossing the saddle - it was soft but the feet stayed dry. This was the only find of the day. After this we went on to Mullaghcleevaun proper.</li><li>2008-07-27T19:00:00Z : Found it by toczygroszek <br />Found but... 53 m from point 0 in other group of rocks! Who moved it?? Last log in logbook is "Found by Martin 27/4/08 by accident, swapping badge for ski pass". I broth this cache to original spot (I think it's in right place now). TFTC!</li></ul></logs>
