As with most of the Liffey Bridge caches this is a magnetic micro
that is quite easy to find without accurate coordinates. You will
need a pen or pencil with you. Those given above only bring you to
the area. If you require precise coordinates then answer the
following:<br>
<br>
In the English version on the plaque on the bridge the third line
has how many words. Call the answer "A".<br>
<br>
The final coordinates are N53 20.793+A W006 16.828-A<br>
PLEASE REPLACE CAREFULLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER AND MAKE SURE IT IS
CLOSED PROPERLY. ALSO, PLEASE REPLACE EXACTLY WHERE YOU FIND IT.

 Mellows Bridge is a road bridge spanning the Liffey and joining
Queen Street and Arran Quay to the south quays.<br>
In 1683, a stone bridge called Arran Bridge was built in a location
between the upstream Bloody Bridge (see Rory O'More Bridge) and the
downstream Bridge of Dublin (see Fr. Mathew Bridge). Construction
was funded by landowner William Ellis, and Dublin Corporation.<br>
Also known as Bridewell Bridge, this structure stood for 80 years,
but was swept away by a flood in 1763.<br>
 "National Graves Association" plaque (in Irish and English) noting
renaming of bridge.<br>
Designed by Charles Valency (a military engineer) a replacement
bridge on the same site was built between 1764 and 1768 as a three
elliptical arch stone bridge, and named Queens Bridge after
Charlotte of Mecklenburg, queen consort of George III.<br>
In 1923 the bridge was renamed for the legendary Queen Maeve by the
fledgling Free State. However, it was renamed again in 1942 to its
current name, for republican Liam Mellows who was executed during
the Irish Civil War.<br>
At almost 250 years old, Mellow's Bridge remains the oldest of all
Dublin city bridges still in use.<br>
<br>
 Nomenclature<br>
As with other bridges on the Liffey in Dublin, and largely because
of the many name changes, Mellow's Bridge is known locally by
several names, including: Queen's Bridge, Queen's Street Bridge,
Queen Maeve Bridge, and Mellowes Bridge (with an "e").<br></long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

These brigdes are nice; all different from each other.

Thanks for this one...
