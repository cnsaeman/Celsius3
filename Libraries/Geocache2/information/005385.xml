<p><b>Malahide</b> which means "on the brow of the sea" is a
village nine miles north of Dublin. The castle is close to the
village and is built on a small rise which commands a view of the
bay. There are many magnificent oaks, chestnuts and sycamores
dating to the days of the Tudors. The hall of the castle is one of
the purest specimens of Norman architecture but it is not known
whether it dates from the reign of Henry IV or from that of Edward
IV when the original building was considerably enlarged and
embellished. The circular towers flanking the facade were added in
1765.</p>

Only found because of Christian's infinite patience, I lost mine ages ago!

Suggest size could be upgraded - was looking for something smaller! Still, impressed with the cache, had lots of great goodies, including a full disposable camera.
