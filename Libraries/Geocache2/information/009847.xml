  <description><center>This magnetic cache is part of series dedicated to Irish
sport. Please rehide it well so that it will not fall on the
ground. The coordinates above are for reference only. For the real
coords you will need to complete a sport quiz, which is mixture of
questions about games rules, Irish sportsmen, and general knowledge
of Irish and international sport and history. For some it might be
easy and for others rather tricky but that's the name of the
game.<br />
Good luck!</center></description>

<p>Morton Stadium, or the National Athletics Stadium, is an
athletics stadium in Santry, in the north of Dublin City. Often
called Santry Stadium, it is the centre for athletics events in
Ireland, and home track of Clonliffe Harriers. It has also hosted
the home games of soccer clubs Shamrock Rovers (from 1999-2001) and
Dublin City. It is currently home to Sporting Fingal FC. The
stadium was opened in 1958 with a cinder track. An inaugural series
of meetings was held, and on 6 August 1958, Australian Herb Elliott
shattered the world record for the mile with a time of 3 minutes
54.5 seconds. This was the first race in which five athletes had
run a four minute mile. In 1978 the stadium was resurfaced with a
tartan track, the first such in the Republic of Ireland. In the
early 1990s it was renamed after Billy Morton, the late
administrator who had initiated the original track and who brought
famous athletes to compete in the stadium. It hosted the athletics
events of the Special Olympics World Games in 2003. The stadium
consists of a small covered stand with 800 seats and three sides of
open terracing, bringing the total capacity up to 8,800. The stand
encompasses dressing rooms and other facilities; there are also
separate clubhouses for the associated clubs. The stadium complex
also has indoor athletics training facilities. On 25 July 2008, a
special event was held in the stadium called the Morton Memorial
Meeting to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the aforementioned
world mile record in an event promoted by the late Billy Morton.
The event website is www.mortonmemorial.com where there are photos
of the 1958 event.</p></center>
