We sadly had to discover that ca each second cache has been wet sometimes with the log mouldy. Please check by your cache as soon as possible to change the log!
</li><li>2010-03-07T20:00:00Z : Found it by John NW <br />How long is the Runway!!!!!?????? This was a long long walk from the last cache on the otherside of the runway! The warmth made it fun too - at least I could spot planes, enjoy a walk in the sun and find caches - could the day get any better?!??!?! The cache was in a bit of a rundown area with lots of litter, if you have youngsters beware, trust the co-ordinates as they were bang on for me. TNLN TFTC</li></ul></logs>
