  <description>A different view of Dublin</description>
  <long-description>Placed away from the beach on the side adjoining the golf course.  Don't be put off if your gps map places you in water. The mapping for Ireland is limited and you will only get wet if you want to! If you approach from the harbour side, you may see the sign showing where the cache name comes from.</long-description>
  <encoded-hints>Check out behind the long grass adjoining the fence.</encoded-hints>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-12T19:00:00Z : Found it by abra123cadabra <br />Just a few metres away from where we searched last time. Managed to get there from the beach without soaking our shoes. A bit windy on the bull wall and the beach but nice and warm walking cross country. Thanks for getting us out of the house today.</li><li>2010-06-08T19:00:00Z : Found it by Gruntplace <br />TFTC. Not a sinner around until just as I am searching for it and then someone appears out of thin air!!

TFTC, eve</li><li>2010-05-21T19:00:00Z : Found it by GudrunXY <br />A long, long way to walk and no one, I mean no one on the way and I finally arrive at the location and what do I see a dog and his owner coming right at me. So I grab my camera and picture to the left, picture to the right, turning around once more, hoping that they would walk a bit faster. After they were finally gone it was easy to find.
TFTC, GudrunXY</li><li>2010-05-16T19:00:00Z : Found it by Takemountain <br />TFTC! Lovely weather and a nice cach, perfect!</li><li>2007-08-30T07:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Found with CMB50 - we took the long way around and got to see a lot of the island as a result. Some gorgeous plant and birdlife, but after the walk we were very tired!
