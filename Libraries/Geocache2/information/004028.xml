  <description>Traditional cache located on the Wicklow way on the edge of
Tibradden Wood not too far from The Pine Forest Arts Centre. There
is parking space for one or two cars at a squeeze about 10 minutes
walk from the cache; N53 13.724, E6 15.889. Not too much to it. The
name of the cache comes from the following poem which came into my
mind on the way up the hill.</description>

<br />
The Fairies <br />
<br />
Up the airy mountain <br />
Down the rushy glen, <br />
 We daren't go a-hunting, <br />
For fear of little men; <br />
Wee folk, good folk, <br />
Trooping all together; <br />
Green jacket, red cap, <br />
And white owl's feather!<br />
 <br />
Down along the rocky shore <br />
Some make their home, <br />
 They live on crispy pancakes <br />
Of yellow tide-foam; <br />
Some in the reeds <br />
Of the black mountain-lake, <br />
With frogs for their watch-dogs, <br />
All night awake. <br />
<br />
High on the hill-top <br />
The old King sits; <br />
 He is now so old and grey <br />
He's nigh lost his wits. <br />
With a bridge of white mist <br />
Columbkill he crosses, <br />
On his stately journeys <br />
From Slieveleague to Rosses; <br />
Or going up with music, <br />
On cold starry nights, <br />
To sup with the Queen <br />
 Of the gay Northern Lights. <br />
<br />
They stole little Bridget <br />
For seven years long; <br />
When she came down again <br />
Her friends were all gone. <br />
They took her lightly back, <br />
Between the night and morrow; <br />
They thought she was fast asleep, <br />
 But she was dead with sorrow. <br />
They have kept her ever since <br />
Deep within the lake, <br />
On a bed of flag leaves, <br />
Watching till she wake. <br />
<br />
By the craggy hill-side, <br />
Through the mosses bare, <br />
They have planted thorn trees <br />
 For pleasure here and there. <br />
Is any man so daring <br />
As dig them up in spite? <br />
He shall find their sharpest thorns<br />
In his bed at night. <br />
<br />
Up the airy mountain <br />
Down the rushy glen, <br />
We daren't go a-hunting<br />
 For fear of little men; <br />
Wee folk, good folk, <br />
Trooping all together; <br />
Green jacket, red cap, <br />
And white owl's feather!<br />
