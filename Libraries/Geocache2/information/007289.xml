<p>Castletown House, Celbridge, County Kildare, Ireland's finest
Palladian country house, is an imposing building built in 1722 for
William Conolly, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. It
formed the centrepiece of a 550 acre estate. Sold to developers in
1965, the estate is now divided between State and private
ownership, with the house and 120 acres in Government care, and
part of the lands now occupied by a modern housing estate.</p>
<b>The Cache:</b> Start at N53 20.932, W006 31.816 Look around and
count the number of full pillars surrounding the house? Answer = A
N53 21.(A+481) , W006 31.(A+656)
<p><b>The cache is a medium size loc-box wrapped in a black
covering.</b></p></long-description>
