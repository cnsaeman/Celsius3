  <description>The cache is located close to the Pact Woodland project.</description>
  <long-description>The Pact Woodland project was initiated to commemorate 50 years of Pact's service. It's aim; to create a special commemorative area for all those who have been touched by adoption and unplanned pregnancy. The area is used by the local community and as a special place for meetings, reunions and reflection.


In 2004 Pact approached South Dublin County Council put forward the idea to "adopt" an existing beech woodland within East Tymon Park.
A sculpture as a central feature

Three hands represent the three main areas of the agency's work and also symbolises the way in which an individual is held through the counselling process.
The story of adopting a woodland

When a child is adopted, he or she gains two families: a birth family and an adoptive family. In a similar way the beech woodland within East Tymon Park now has two families; the local community are its original family and the Pact community it's adopted one

As part of the Pact woodland project, Pact decided to hold art workshops with each of these families.
The Pact Adopted Persons Art Workshop

Children and adults who had been adopted through Pact were invited to fill a small canvas with some art on the theme "Nurture and Nature" and the returned art was framed together. The work is on display at the Pact office.
The Pact Community Art Workshop

Children from the local community, in particular St. Judes' and Faughs' GAA clubs which border the park, were invited to participate in a series of workshops held in the woodland itself and later in Faugh's hall. They began by exploring the wood, making sketches and listening to stories about adoption. In later workshops they used their sketches to design and create clay tiles. The tiles were glazed in colour and then fired before being permanently displayed in the park between the lakes and pitches.
The launch

The Pact Woodland was officially adopted on the 9th of September 2006 and the Pact Sculpture 'Cliabhán' unveiled by Cllr. Eamonn Maloney, Mayor of South Dublin County Council. Miriam O'Callaghan attended the launch and released approximately 1200 balloons, one for every child adopted through Pact since 1952.</long-description>
