  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by poross <br />It was easy even so great hide. I left there a travelbug with agent Simba. They'd like to travel around Europe than go to Africa. Their last steps were in Hungary.</li><li>2010-05-09T19:00:00Z : Found it by merann <br />Couldn't look for the cache 1st time we were here, Mass was just out and there were lots of muggles about. Found it no bother when we returned in the afternoon. Lovely church.
Out - Paper clip.
In - Screwdriver keyring.
TFTC, Merann. </li><li>2010-04-18T19:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />Found this cache ater a little hint from a previous finder as the co-ords were bringing us to a different place.

#303</li><li>2010-04-18T19:00:00Z : Found it by Blue Jay 59 <br />Expected this to be a real easy & quick cache & dash. But bad timing (Mass start time) and jumping co-ords (which put us searching around the bushes in completely the wrong area.) Quick call to a previous finder and we were soon between a rock & a hard place [:)]

Located GPS 0 but after a little bit of searching it was clear that there would be no find here. A look around showed a likely place and sure enough there we found it all tucked up. Lots of bugs... but none of the geo-kind.</li></ul></logs>
