  <description><b>Cache description</b>
<p>The cache is a small lock-and-lock box. It is hidden in the
townland of Killegar, in the vicinity of the ruins of an early
Christian church. When hidden it contained logbook and pencil, a
clockwork toy, some cool animal stickers, TB "Escargot" and a
Slovenian bank-note. It is approximately 800 metres from the road
along a public right of way.</p></description>
  <long-description><b>Access</b>
<p><i>Car/Cycle</i> The recommended way to access this cache is
from the R117 Dublin-Enniskerry Road. You can park safely at a
disused gateway near the Texaco garage.</p>
<p><i>Public Transport</i> Bus number <a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.dublinbus.ie/your_journey/viewer.asp?route=44">44</a>
will bring you to where you need to start walking. Ask to be let
off at "Monastery", or ring the bell when you see the Texaco petrol
station.</p>
<p>Walking along the road, look carefully at the hedge on the west
side and you will see a stone stile, camouflaged with tree
branches. (N53&deg;12.154' W6&deg;10.650') Climb over (or step
around) this first stile and you are on the old mass path to
Killegar Church. It's a little overgrown, but perfectly
passable.</p>
<p>When you come to the second stile (N53&deg;12.120'
W6&deg;10.773'), note the "half-moon" feature that is said to be a
typical feature of a mass-path. Cross the stile and enter a field.
At some times of the year, you will be walking through long grass,
at other times there will be meadow flowers. Although you are on a
well-established right-of-way, you are now also on private
property. Please respect the rights and legitimate concerns of the
owner, especially if there are animals in the field, and keep well
to the right-hand edge.</p>
<p>At the other end of the field, cross the third stile
(N53&deg;12.214' W6&deg;10.990'). At this point you have a view of
the surrounding hills.</p>
<p>The fourth stile (N53&deg;12.334' W6&deg;11.006') is in the
opposite corner of the field. Again, it's probably best to walk
around the edge of the field rather than cut straight across. When
you cross the fourth stile, the cache is nearby.</p>
<p><b>Killegar Church</b></p>
Through the iron gate in the wall is the ruin of Killegar Church.
If you find the gate is tied shut, please make sure to tie it again
when you leave.
<p>The chancel is still standing and the outline of the nave is
still visible. Here you will find very ancient Christian artefacts
including carved slabs and stones similar to those at Rathmichael,
with patterns including cup marks, concentric circles and linear
decorations, and an apparently broken cross that has been mounted
and labelled as a "tau cross".</p>
<p>It is a peaceful place and the cemetery has continued in
occasional use until recently.</p></long-description>
