Hamilton,<br />
the greatest Irish Mathematician of all time, discovered the

called Quaternions.</center>

<center>For many years he had been trying to find a satisfactory
way to multiply points in three dimensions, in such a way as to
allow division. The idea of using four dimensions instead, and the
way to do it, came to him in a flash, as he walked with his wife by
the Royal Canal. Since it is one of the few major mathematical
discoveries which is precisely located in time and circumstances,
the event is very well-known in the international mathematical
community, and people from all over the world know about
"Hamilton's Bridge". When he made the discovery, Hamilton paused
under Brougham (or Broom) Bridge, took out his penknife, and
scratched the fundamental formula: i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = -1 into the
stone.</center>

<center>A plaque at the bridge reads:</center>
<center><br />
Here as he walked by<br />
Sir William Rowan Hamilton<br />
in a flash of genius discovered<br />
the fundamental formula for<br />
quaternion multiplication<br />
i&sup2; = j&sup2; = k&sup2; = ijk = -1<br />
& cut it on a stone of this bridge.</center>
<p><br /></p>
<center><br />
Given the historical importance of the bridge with respect to
mathematics, mathematicians from all over the world have been known
to take part in the annual commemorative walk from Dunsink
Observatory to the site. Attendees have included Nobel Prize
winners Murray Gell-Mann, Steven Weinberg and Frank Wilczek, and
mathematicians Sir Andrew Wiles and Ingrid Daubechies.</center>

After a few days of head scratching moments, a formula was born and a likely set of numbers appeared.

A brief search at gz unearthed a pristeen log duly signed with a pen not knife [:P]
