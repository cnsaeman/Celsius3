Hardest part was finding out how many volts etc. took a bit of googling. That Prof. Google is marvellous [:)]
Yes different but familiar. 
Had no clue what the hint meant.

#242</li><li>2010-02-19T20:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />Cache no. 1300. 
Took a while to figure out this one and eventually find it! Lucky it's close to where I work so had a few trips out during lunch time. 
</li><li>2010-01-03T20:00:00Z : Found it by snoopyandmickey <br />The brainiac team member needed to solve this one!  TFTC!  </li><li>2009-12-27T20:00:00Z : Found it by Hezekiah <br />Found after a fair bit of head scratching - and a certain amount of car rescue!  Roads were like glass, but 4x4 wins every time - bit baffled by the hint.
