  <description>A VIRTUAL cache to be found on the Howth peninsula</description>
  <long-description>I don't want to give anything away about the cache.  Let's just say that it has musical connections.  There are a number of entrances but the one at N53 22.801 W006 05.614 will be the nearest and most direct.  Take a photo of yourself and/or a GPS reading and send it to me (see my profile for email address) for confirmation.
PLEASE do not post a photo with your log - thanks.
While you're in Howth why not take a trip up to the "summit" at N53 22.243 W006 03.290 and take a look across Dublin Bay and if you are really up for it then "do" the cliff walk all the way into Howth itself.  If you're not into exercise then enjoy a pint in the pub at the bottom of the hill!</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-04-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by hollmanr <br />Got the go ahead from Shakes to log it after visiting the cache on Sunday. Thanks for bringing us here !
</li><li>2010-04-18T19:00:00Z : Found it by Spark_ie <br />I had a fair idea of what the cache was about, sure enough I was right. Nice to be here though.  Took a pic, will send on. TFTC, Spark_ie</li><li>2010-04-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />Once I realised what this cache was, I simply had to do it. My one and only encounter with the 'Black Rose' took place in 1976, about 200 yards from the location of this cache.

Thanks for a great cache!</li><li>2010-02-25T20:00:00Z : Found it by Kolingen <br />This cache was not what I expected but I'm happy to have been here. T4TC
