  <long-description>Mullaghcleevaun, at 849 m, is the second highest in Wicklow, with
views to match! Given the mixture of terrain and the distance
involved (From here, walking time is about 4 hours, climbing 450
metres), map & compass, full wet gear, strong boots and gaiters
are essential.
<p>It is best approached from the Blessington side - take the N81
to Blessington, turn left at the Downshire Arms Hotel in the town
and head down towards the lake. Turn right onto the bridge and then
right at the other end - head for Lacken. In Lacken village (one
shop) fork left uphill to the car park at Ballynultagh Gap (GR
044108 - Sheet 56).</p>
<p>Head up the bog road to the top of Black Hill - the road peters
out before the top, but keep going uphill!</p>
<p>From the top of Black Hill head roughly South East down to the
col - you will see the trail of others gone before. Head uphill
from the col in the same direction to the top of Mullaghcleevaun,
which is marked by a trig point. The cache is situated 100 paces
South West of the trig point, wrapped in black plastic.</p>
<p>Also near the summit is a plaque commemorating 3 An Oige members
who perished at sea - this was their favourite spot, and its easy
to see why, with commanding views over the surrounding mountains.
There was also here, at one time, a sign-post for "Hart's
High-level Route" commemorating the exploits of one Henry
Chichester Hart, who walked with a companion from Trinity College
in the centre of Dublin to Lugnaquilla, returning not by road but
directly across Tonelagee and Mullaghcleevaun! This epic was 65
miles long, done in 23 hours and 50 minutes, including 2 hours and
5 minutes rest - over 100 years ago!</p>
<p>The return journey is the exact reverse – take care no to aim
too far to the North as it is very steep, followed by bog and
forestry - aim too far West and it can be a long, boggy detour</p>
