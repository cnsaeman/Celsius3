<center><b>Queen Maeve on an Irish Punt</b></center></description>
  <long-description><p><b>Rath Maeve</b></p>
<p>This Hill fort is named after Queen Maeve,it originally measured
approximately 250 metres in diameter.<br />
unfortunatley this site which is obviously connected to Tara has
been very neglected all that remains now is a well preserved
embankment near the road leading to Tara.<br />
 Queen Maeve was queen of Connacht during the Iron Age.</p>
<p><b>Queen Maeve</b></p>
<p>Queen Maeve has many names among the druids of Ireland some of
which include Mab/Mabh/Meda(meev)/Medh/Medhbh. She is considered
the "Drunken Woman" or the "Queen-wolf". But nonetheless Maeve is
the queen of the fairy whose name means "mead". Mead was a red
drink or claret that she gave to her many consorts.<br />
 Queen Maeve was also a warrior queen of the Ulster cycle. She was
a Goddess of War that actually participated in the
fighting;combined with mother and warrior aspects of the
goddess.<br />
 Maeve represents physical sexuality and fertility, revenge, and
war!</p>
