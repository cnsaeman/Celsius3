  <long-description><b>"Dublin's Stadia Series 1 - National Aquatic Centre"</b> - this

<br />
The series consists of:<br />
<br />
<table>
<tr>
<td>Croke Park <i>Gaelic Football & Hurling</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Aviva Stadium <i>Soccer & Rugby</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The RDS Ballsbridge <i>Show Jumping</i></td>

The series will bring you to stadia, both old and new, of Dublin

surrounding localities.<br />

<br />
<b>The National Aquatic Centre</b> was developed by the Irish
Government to be a national centre for all aquatic sports in
Ireland. Built at a cost of &euro;62.5 million, it was delivered
both on time and within budget.<br />
<br />
The Centre was officially launched in March 2003. It successfully
hosted the swimming events of the 2003 Special Olympics World
Summer Games, the first time this event was held outside of the
United States. It also hosted the European Short Course Swimming
Championships in December 2003.<br />

<p style="text-align:left">The National Aquatic Centre is one of
the world&rsquo;s largest indoor water centres. It
comprises:-<br /></p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>A 10-lane 50 metre x 25 metre international standard swimming
pool with two moveable floors which will allow it to be
reconfigured for other uses</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A 25 metre international standard diving pool/warm- up
pool</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extensive leisure waters including adventure water rides, with
children&rsquo;s play pool and wave pool</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Seating for 2,500 spectators</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A Fitness Centre</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br />
The National Aquatic Centre, which was originally operated under
lease by a private operator, reverted back into State ownership in
December 2006.<br />
The National Aquatic Centre is now under the remit of the National
Sports Campus Development Authority and is operated by NSCDA
(Operations) Ltd which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Authority. Since coming under NSCDA control, the National Aquatic
Centre has gone from strength to strength. In 2008 over 700,000
people used the facilities of the Centre.<br />
