  <description>This cache was named after one I placed in Mariposa, California but I couldn't find a local to maintain it for me. It is sited near to Howth Castle and The National Transport Museum</description>
  <long-description>The National Transport Museum
This is Ireland's only comprehensive assembly of public service and commercial road transport. Even the humblest vehicles are noteworthy; many are the sole extant examples of once familiar types; several others are very rare and some are unique. Portraying the Golden Age of commercials, the collection includes some 30 marques, more than half of them now demised. All four Irish commercial vehicle builders are represented.
The Opening times for the museum Sat and Sun 2-5pm.Summer time (June,July and Aug) ,mon- fri 10- 5 pm</long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

What a lovely place. Nice surprise. It was getting late, so we returned to Dublin to have dinner.

Thanks for this one...
