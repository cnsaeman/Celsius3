  <long-description>Visited the cache recently. Very overgrown

***** MAKE SURE YOU WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING*******

Nearest Dart stations are Killiney and Dalkey, they are both easily accessible to this cache. The nearest bus stop is on Killiney Hill road which serves the 59 bus route from Dun Laoghaire via Sandycove and Dalkey. There is also parking up on the Vico road, a short walk from the cache.

I would also like if some cachers could post a photo of the views from the cache</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-03-27T19:00:00Z : Found it by didi2206 <br />We came back today and thankfully were more successful!! 
The GPS wasn't too happy but I think the coords are a bit of- I'd put the W/E at 6.458  rather than 6.468... also do not approach directly from the Vico Road... people throw rubbish over the low wall and it's a bad idea to scramble down through it...took a key chain and left a badge fom the London Science Museum...TFTC !!!</li><li>2010-03-17T19:00:00Z : Found it by AbbeyAckbar <br />(#616 @ 15:53)
Lovely cache with lots of goodies inside. We took the TB & left a geocoin. Our GPSr wasn't spot on, but we just looked in the likely hiding places & Ackbar came up with the find. Thank goodness we found this cache now, I imagine the route would be quite overgrown in the Summer time.
