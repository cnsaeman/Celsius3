 A traditional cache at the Bohernabreena reservoir</description>
  <long-description><b>Glenasmole/ Bohernabreena</b><br />
The River Dodder rises in the mountains above Bohernabreena
Reservoir south of Dublin and flows in a north-easterly direction
for 14 miles through the southern side of the city before entering
the Irish Sea at Dublin Bay. In the 1880s this water source was
trapped behind two dams to provide water for both Rathmines/
Rathgar and the many mills which harnessed the water power. There
are excellent examples of the traditional stone mason's craft in
the reservoirs and the walkways bear witness to Victorian landscape
makers. The Bohernabreena reservoir is one of a network, Vartry and
Poulaphuca are much more extensive, which service the ever growing
demands of the city below. 
<p>Today, the Bohernabreena Reservoir provides the raw water supply
to the Ballyboden Treatment Works which delivers an estimated 18
million litres of water into the Dublin region water supply per
day. This accounts for approximately 3% of the overall Dublin
supply. The Bohernabreena reservoir is of strategic importance to
the overall water supply for the Dublin region.</p>
<p><b>Some history</b><br />
The Glenasmole Valley has a strong historical tradition. Glenasmole
is the location of many of the legendary stories of Fionn Mac
Cumhaill (my namesake !)and the Fianna. The place names of
'Seafinn' and 'Ballymorefinn' bear witness to this legacy. The
Dublin Historical Record (August 1961) records the fact that in
1800 few people in the Valley spoke English and that the Irish
language was spoken in the Valley well into the 20th Century.
Throughout documented history, the Valley has been part of the
extended church lands of the Archdiocese of Dublin. In a paper
entitled "Society and Settlement" in the Valley of Glenasmole c1750
- c1900, William Nolan traces the pattern of rural development
within the Valley through the centuries.</p>

<p><b>The Cache</b><br />
You can reach this cache by car from two directions - either take
the Firhouse/ Knocklyon exit on the M50, or take the tougher drive
from Sally Gap.<br />
*Update Nov 2005* Currently there is no car park because of works
going on in the reservoir. However, there is enough space for one
or two cars in front of the gate beside the bridge. The path on the
right-hand side of the reservoir is currently off-limits because of
works going on.<br />
The terrain is very easy, so suitable for kids, dogs (on leads!)
and bikes. Note this cache is only available from dawn until
dusk.<br />
The cache is a see-through Tupperware box, which at the time of
placing contained a toy cap-gun, multi-tool, Star Wars CD<br />
 and mini portable radio.</p>
