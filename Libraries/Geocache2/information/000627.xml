  <long-description><p><b>Séamus Ennis 1919-1982</b></p>
<p>Séamus Ennis, uillean piper, folklore and music collector, was
born on May 5, 1919 in Jamestown in Finglas, then a rural part of
North County Dublin. His father was James Ennis, who was a
prize-winning musician on several instruments including the Uilean
pipes and also a champion dancer. Séamus had two brothers and three
sisters. None of his brothers or sisters took up music
professionally, but his daughter Catherine is a well known organist
and his son Chris plays the fiddle and sings. One of the main
streets in Finglas has by popular acclaim, been re-named Séamus
Ennis Road.</p>
<b>Childhood</b><br />
<br />
 
<p>Séamus Ennis was introduced to music at a very early age. His
father used to play the pipes to him in his cradle. There were many
musical visitors to the house. Pipers Liam Andrews of Dublin and
Pat Ward of Drogheda, James McCrone, a reed maker, fiddle player
Frank O'Higgins and John Cawley (flute) were frequent visitors.
This obviously influenced Séamus because, at the age of two, his
father heard him trying to hum a tune, and this prompted him to
carve an imitation set of pipes for his son. He knew the names of
some of the tunes when he was only three years old.</p>
Séamus attended the Holy Faith Convent in Glasnevin and Belvedere
College. Then he attended all-Irish schools at Scoil Cholm Cille
and Colaiste Mhuire. This gave him a good grounding in Irish which
he developed to the full in his travels around Ireland collecting
songs and tunes. He had an uncanny ability to converse in the
regional Gaelic dialects with people in Connemara, Donegal, Kerry
and even Scotland. Séamus developed his skill in writing down music
by listening attentively to the singers of traditional slow airs.
This gift would prove invaluable when in the early 1940's he would
travel the country as music archivist for the Dept. of Folklore at
U.C.D. Séamus's travels were by push bike in the 1940's as it was
during the war years and he collected all his tunes by pen and
paper. 
<p><b>Working Years</b></p>
<p>When Séamus left school he was employed by Colm O'Lochlainn at
the Three Candle Press and learned all the tasks associated with
the printing trade as well as learning to write down slow airs in
staff notation along with the ability to write dance music his
father had taught him. Colm O'Lochlainn was a major cause for his
love for the Irish language. It was Colm who introduced Séamus to
Professor Séamus O'Duilearge of the Irish Folklore Commission.</p>
<p>The first of his travels for the Irish Folklore Commission was
to Connemara where he met a man named Pat Cannin. He asked Séamus
did he know a reel which he whistled to him. Séamus wrote the reel
on a piece of paper by the side of the road and named it The Mist
on the Mountain.</p>
<p>Séamus found the greatest repository of songs and tunes and
their background in fact and fame in a little pocket of North
Connemara in a place called Glinnsce, "Clear Water" in English. He
recorded two hundred and twelve items straight from the memory of
Colm O'Caoidheain who lived in this area.</p>
<p>The Irish Folklore Commission then asked Séamus to focus his
attention on the musical heritage Ireland shared with Scotland.
This involved him travelling to Scotland in 1946. This was the year
where the winter was bitterly cold, but, this didn't stop Seamus
from swimming every day and he became known as the mad Irishman. In
1946 he applied for a job in Radio Eireann as an Outside Broadcast
Officer. He commenced this job in August 1947. It was not long
before Séamus proved himself to be a skilled presenter. On a visit
to Clare in 1949 he recorded Willie Clancy, Bobby Casey, Sean Reid,
Martin Talty and Micho Russell.</p>
<p>In 1951 Séamus moved to London to work with the BBC on a scheme
aimed at recording extensively the surviving folk culture of
England, Scotland and Wales. He travelled all over Ireland and
Britain collecting material and was one of the presenters of the
radio programme "As I Roved Out". He married Maragaret Glynn in
1952 and had two children, Catherine and Christopher. In 1958 his
marriage ended and he returned to Ireland where he did freelance
work with Radio Eireann and presented programmes such as An
Ceoltoir Sidhe and Seamus Ennis san Chathaoir on RTE. Séamus
performed around Ireland during the 1960's and played at the first
meeting of Na Piobairi Uileann in Bettystown Co Meath in 1968.</p>
<p>In the early 1970's he shared accommodation with piper Liam
O'Floinn in Dublin. Seamus left a last impression on Liam O'Floinn
who was in awe of his knowledge and expertise. Séamus left his set
of pipes to Liam. These pipes were orginally purchased by Seamus's
father in a second hand shop in London. They were made by Morris
Coyne in 1830's.</p>
<p>He returned to The Naul in 1975 to live out his remaining years
in a mobile home which he called "Easter Snow" which was one of his
favourite tunes. His sister lived with him on this land which
belonged to their grandparents. The Séamus Ennis Cultural Centre is
now situated on this site. He continued playing around Ireland
right up to the time he lost his battle with cancer in October,
1982 aged 63. One of his last performances was at the Willie Clancy
Summer School of 1982 and the Lisdoonvarna Folk Festival.</p>

I got to the co ords and was confronted by loads of potential hiding spaces, I started my search. Twenty odd minutes later I still hadn’t located it. I read through the logs and some of them suggested a fifteen meter error. I expanded the search but still had no luck.

I was reminded that the evenings are shortening as even by half six the light had started to fade slightly especially in this leafy laneway. I decided to leave it as I had spent too much time here. Will be back though. Serapis.
