  <long-description>Located in St. Enda's Park, nestling in the foothills of the Dublin mountains. This cache is a small black container, hidden close to a cave-like folly.

TFTC</li><li>2010-04-03T19:00:00Z : Found it by Frezeluberz <br />Tried this cache last year before the Easter Eggstravaganza but was running late and only got 5 minutes at it.
Back this year and we had all the time in the world ... we were going to need it.
Turns out we weren't looking in the right area.
Fortunately enough though, AbbeyAckbar and B.Bubbles turned up.
I think it was AbbeyAckbar who were able to identify that we were searching in completely the wrong place.
They have found it previously ... but couldn't remember where :(
The hunt contniued, but this time in the right location.
Soon enough the hide was discovered.
Nice camo and good hide.
