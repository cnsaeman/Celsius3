<p>Few cities have such a facility on their doorsteps &ndash; it is
more than twice as large as Central Park in New York.</p>
<p>The park was for centuries the property of the King&rsquo;s
representatives in Ireland, used as a Royal hunting park &ndash;
which is why it was enclosed by a wall, to keep the game in.</p>
<p>However it was opened to the public in 1747 and so for more than
250 years has been a favourite playground for generations of
Dubliners.</p>
<p>The Park is also home to the Zoological Gardens and Aras an
Uachtarain and Victorian flower gardens. The Phoenix Park is only
1.5 miles from O'Connell Street. Both passive and active
recreational pursuits may be viewed or pursued such as walking,
running, polo, cricket, hurling, etc. The Glen Pond is set in very
scenic surrounds in the Furry Glen. There are many walks and cycle
routes available to the public.</p>
<p>The park is open all year round, there is no admission charge
and visitors can explore freely.</p>

<p>Bus Route(s): No's 10, 37, 38, 39, 66, 67 from city centre.</p>
<p>The cache is located on a trek adjacent to the gate
