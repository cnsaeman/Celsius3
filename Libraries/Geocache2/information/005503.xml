  <description><b>Cache Description</b> 
<p>The cache is a 2-stage multi. The posted co-ordinates are those
of the megalithic site at Ballyedmonduff (<i>Baile Éamoinn
Dhuibh</i> - Black-haired Edward's townland). There you will find
an information board, which will be used to work out the
co-ordinates of the final stage, which is hidden in the forest. The
cache container is a 1 litre lock-and-lock box. Approximate
round-trip distance from the road is 1.8 km along forest roads and
paths.</p></description>
  <long-description><b>Access</b> 
<p><i>Car/Cycle</i> From the Dublin-Enniskerry Road (R117) you may
approach the site by turning right either at Stepaside or
Kilternan. The roads in this area are narrow and winding, so
caution is advised.</p>
<p>- From Kilternan, follow R116 up to Glencullen crossroads
(Johnny Fox's pub, 3.0 km), then turn right and drive another 1.3
km.</p>
<p>- From the crossroads in Stepaside, follow the road for 2.5
km.</p>
<p><i>Parking</i> There is space for one car beside the gate of a
nearby house. See waypoint below. Please park safely and
considerately.</p>
<p><i>Public Transport</i> Bus number <a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.dublinbus.ie/your_journey/viewer.asp?route=44B">44B</a>
passes along this road, but is exceptionally infrequent so please
study the timetable before setting out. Routes <a rel="nofollow"
href=

and <a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.dublinbus.ie/your_journey/viewer.asp?route=118">118</a>
serve Stepaside village. From there to the cache site is 4 km
each-way.</p>
<p><i>On foot, Other</i> Those in possession of a good local
knowledge or a very good sense of direction may approach the
location along the network of woodland and mountain paths that link
Ticknock, Tibradden, Two Rock and Kilmashogue mountains. The OS map
is quite inadequate in this regard.</p>
<p><i>Directions</i> From Ballyedmonduff Road, climb over the gate
(see waypoint below) and cross the field to the forestry gate. Once
inside the forest, turn left at the junction, passing Glencullen
Golf Course on your left, and follow the path around until you see
the monument in a little clearing on your right.</p>
<p><b>Description of the Monument</b></p>
<p>This gallery grave was built by early Bronze Age farmers around
1700 BC, and is said to have been rediscovered by Alderman Blacker
of Dublin in the 1830s. Some stones were taken away by local
stonemasons over the years. It was excavated in 1935 (or 1945
according to some sources) by deValera and O'Ríordáin, yielding
fragments of pottery (described as "beaker sherds and coarse
Neolithic ware" - in other words a mix of late Stone Age and early
Bronze Age), stone tools and charred bone. It is thought that the
excavation was unsympathetic by modern standards, and that the
monument was substantially reduced.</p>
<p>Although the main chamber appears perfectly rectangular, it is
classed as a wedge-tomb because the cairn in which it was enclosed
was wedge- or oval-shaped. It is also possible that the chamber was
originally wedge-shaped and was subject to well-meaning
"improvements" in the 20th century. It is one of 3 wedge-tombs in
the Barony of Rathdown, the other two being at Kilmashogue and
Laughanstown.</p>
<p>The monument is exceptionally - suspiciously? - well-preserved.
The main axis is oriented east-west. The chamber is divided into
three parts, probably two burial chambers and an ante-chamber. The
whole was enclosed in a cairn of stones and earth retained by a
"kerb" consisting of a horseshoe-shaped double-wall of upright
stones.</p>

<p><b>Final Stage Co-ordinates</b></p>
<p>To find the co-ordinates of the final stage, please refer to the
3 sentences of the English-language description on the information
board.</p>
<ul>
<li>A = second word of third sentence</li>
<li>B = sixth word of second sentence</li>
<li>C = seventh word of second sentence</li>
<li>D = second word of second sentence</li>
<li>E = fourth word of second sentence</li>
<li>F = eleventh word of second sentence</li></ul>
The cache is hidden at <b>N53°13.ABC W6°13.DEF</b>. GPS reception
at the location is likely to be poor, especially in wet weather. 
<p>Some extra advice for reaching the final stage. Either return to
the forest gate and take the grassy path, following it as it curves
around to the left. Or else walk anticlockwise around the gravel
path until you are around 50 metres from the final stage, then
through a gap in the rocks and across the mearing ditch.</p>
<p>Once there you will find a flat-faced stone that shows signs of
working and may be an undocumented ancient standing stone.</p>
