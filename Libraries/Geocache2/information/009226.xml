Dublin and is perched on top of the Rock of Cloghran, owned by the
Church of Ireland. This site is a national monument that had been

serious state of neglect. Cloghran Historical Society obtained
permission from the owners to initiate a restoration
programme.<br />
Work commenced on the restoration project in 2003 with the
restoration of the graves and a complete clean-up of the site. When
this was complete the work moved on to restoring the walls
surrounding the graveyard.<br />
There was of 18th century church which is now demolished and was
also built on the site of earlier<br />
Church dating back to the 12 century which was built by by Ryryd,
son of Owen Gwyneth, Prince of North Wales.</p>
