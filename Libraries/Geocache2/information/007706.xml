  <long-description><p>1. The posted coordinates are the coordinates for the
cache,However in order to log a find you will need to complete the
full grid an example of which is shown in the image above. there
are a total of 81 differant cache types needed to be found before
you can log this cache.</p>
<p>2. Generally accepted rules, guidelines and conditions for
logging a cache find apply. Caches must be listed on Gecaching.com
you personally (physically) must have found and logged all the
required caches.</p>
<p>3. Cache types that count as finds for the challenge are as
follows:</p>
<p><img src=

<p>4. While you may have others with you when you find the final
cache, only those who have fulfilled all criteria for this cache
will be allowed to log it as a find. Find logs by other cachers
that do not meet the requirements will be deleted.</p>
<p>5. Only the Difficulty/Terrain (Star) ratings as listed on cache
pages will be accepted. I am only responsible for this cache
page&hellip;if a cache owner changes a rating either up or down and
causes a loss in one of the Difficulty/Terrain ratings before you
find the cache, you will need to find an additional cache to
complete that requirement. If a cache owner changes a rating up or
down and causes a loss in one of the Difficulty/Terrain ratings
after you find the cache, you are NOT expected to find an
additional cache (but if you were dedicated enough to find all
these ratings&hellip;could you really live with yourself if you
didn&rsquo;t try again.</p>
<p>6. How do you track your caches? There are three options: 1)
Create a bookmark list and keep track 2) Upload your My Finds PQ to
It's Not About The Numbers 3) Use FizzyMagic's FindStats Program
(this requires a download)</p>
<p>7. When you have found all of the required combinations, post a
note to this cache page and include a link to your shared bookmark
list showing all the caches that meet the requirements.</p>
<p>8. Please use a shared bookmark list (and link) available to
other cachers for a minimum of a few months after completing the
challenge.</p>
<p>9. For nine of the caches on your bookmark list, include what
type (i.e., Traditional, Virtual, EarthCache) of cache it is in the
comments section for that cache. Make sure each of the nine
required cache types are included. Please do not do this for every
cache on the list.</p>
<p>10. A minimum of 81 caches are needed on your bookmark list to
be eligible to log the final.</p>
<p>11. After you have posted your note with the needed shared
bookmark list, please wait patiently for the cache owner to verify
your list.</p>
<p>12. Once verification has shown that you have successfully
completed the challenge you can then log the cache.</p>
<p>13. Remember that this is a game and is supposed to be fun.</p>
<p>The Difficulty/Terrain (Star) rating for this cache is set as a
5/5 to reflect the overall ratings for the caches that need to be
found for this challange.<br />
The actual rating is 1.5/2 at most. This cache cannot be used as
the required 5/5 cache.</p></long-description>
