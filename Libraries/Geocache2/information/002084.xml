  <description>The cache is a tuberware box hidden close to Portmarnock Beach.</description>
  <long-description>Portmarnock (Port Mearnóg) beach is an attractive 5 kilometre stretch beach, backed by sand dunes, joining Baldoyle and Malahide beach. The name Portmarnock originated from Irish meaning port, and St.Marnock who arrived there in the fifth century. It was from the Velvet Strand (as the beach is also known), on the 24th of June 1930 that the famous Australian aircraft ‘Southern Cross’ departed on a pioneering Atlantic flight to Newfoundland. The plane was piloted by the Australian Charles Kingford Smith and navigated by the Dubliner Captain J.P. Saul. A limestone monument in the shape of a globe (‘Eccentric Orbit’) has been erected as a tribute to the journey.
The beach is popular for horse riding, swimming, walking and wind and kite surfing and on a clear day has stunning views of Ireland's Eye, Howth and Lambay Island.
The suggested starting point for this cache is a carpark accessed by the Golf links Road. The co-ordinates for this are N053 24.997 W006 07.670 and from here you can access the cache by following pathways through the dunes. 

Please note the following :

The sand dunes on Portmarnock beach are an important natural feature. Sand dunes are a sensitive habitat and depend on marram grass to stop the wind from blowing the sand away. The root system of the marram grass acts as a protective cover for the dunes. The dunes can be eroded by the action of the wind, tides and excessive trampling. You can help to prevent erosion of the dunes by walking and playing on the strand rather than the dunes.
Parts of the dune system are fenced off at times, which restricts access. Unfortunately, this is necessary to protect the dunes by planting marram grass and allowing it to become established without interference. 

At time of hiding there were no fenced off areas in the vicinity of the cache. However if at any stage you think the area where the cache is hidden is within a fenced off area please do not enter. We would also appreciate it if you could notify us in the event of this happening.
