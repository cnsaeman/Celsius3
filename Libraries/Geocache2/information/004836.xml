<p align="justify"><b>The Bottle Tower</b><br />
<br />
At Whitehall Road in Rathfarnham there stands a curious structure.
It is named the Bottle Tower for its unique shape. It's also known
as Hall's Barn. It was built in 1742 in imitation of Wonderful Barn
near Leixlip, but wasn't so well constructed. The ground floor was
used as a barn, and 1st and 2nd floors were residential. Behind the
barn a smaller structure was built in of similar shape and was used
as a pigeon house. Beside the Bottle Tower there was a house named
Whitehall, converted later to a boarding house. Some years later
the house and the pigeon house were demolished. Not being used, the
Bottle Tower fell into a ruin, but fortunately survived, being now
one of the most distinctive structures in Rathfarnham.<br />
<br />
 <b>The Bottle Cache</b><br />
<br />
Bottle Tower is located on private ground with no access, but the
start point is just beside it. At listed coordinates you will see a
post with a black number on a yellow plate. Call this number
<b>A</b>. Below it you will find a 4-digit number - call it
<b>BCDE</b>.<br />
<br />
The cache is at coordinates:<br />
<br />
<b>N53° 1(B+1).CDC<br />
W006° 1E.C(D-E+1)(D-A)</b></p>

Great cache this, loved the final location and the container was great.

Only thing I noticed though was that there are two poles at the start point, with slightly different numbers. One led to a set of coord about 1.4km away though, so figured that probably wasnt it!! Might be an idea to say whether the pole is north or south of the bottle house.
