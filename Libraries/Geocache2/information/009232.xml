grounds.</p>

Traffic was fierce round the junction at the top of the road.
Eventually resolved the ambiguity and got the second IP.
Headed to GZ and the CO himself turned up ... how handy.
But poor Wildflower & Alastair74 should be ashamed ... being handed caches?!?!
Dunno about that one lads ...
Can't really complain as that's what happened for us here - got handed the cache by the CO.
Although, we weren't handed 35!! of them :P
