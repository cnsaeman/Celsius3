Although someone had stashed a couple of lucozade bottles beside the cache it was strange they didn't see it.  TNLNSL TFTC</li><li>2009-07-19T19:00:00Z : Found it by abra123cadabra <br />Driving along an empty country road to the cache location. While we were looking for a good place to park a queue formed behind us. Had to go much further to turn around and finally park opposite the memorial. Location was quickly determined but retrieving was another matter altogether. Wouldn't like to do this when it's wet. If you're not careful you slide down right into the river.
