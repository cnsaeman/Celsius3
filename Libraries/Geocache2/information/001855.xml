  <description>Simple cache in a really peaceful area.</description>
  <long-description>The exact date of this church remains unclear. The ruins are in the
townland of Lehaunestown and are said to be of Danish origin.<br />
Supposedly dating from the ninth century, the chancel was only
added during the thirteenth century. 
<p>The church may have been founded or at least had a close
association with a St. Brigid. This could push back the date of the
church<br />
 as St. Brigid died in 523 A.D., so the original church would have
to date from the sixth century in that case.</p>
<p>There is another Brigid who could be the person connected with
Tully, a sister of the five holy ladies of Killiney church.<br />
Either way Tully was granted to the Priory of the Holy Trinity in
1179 and by 1615 it too was in ruins. After 1641 the church was no
longer in use.</p>
You should take a few minutes to also check out the cross in the
field on the other side of the road before you leave. 
<p><b>Getting there:</b><br />
From Cabinteely village, take the Brennanstown Road SW, and turn
off onto the little Lehaunstown Road at N53 15.327, W6
09.242,<br />
 and continue to the end of the road.<br />
When going back, there is a space to turn your car around further
down the road.</p>
