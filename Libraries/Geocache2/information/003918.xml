  <long-description><p>The date of the foundation of the Castle is uncertain, but
recent research would suggest 1583 as the most likely date. It was
built by Adam Loftus, a Yorkshireman. The Castle has 18th century
interiors by Sir William Chambers and James Athenian Stuart and was
declared a National Monument in the mid-1980s. The Castle is
presented to visitors as a castle undergoing active conservation.
The visitor can see, at first hand, tantalizing glimpses of layers
of the Castles earlier existence uncovered during research.
(Conservation works are ongoing at the site).</p>
<p>Location: Rathfarnham By-Pass, between Rathfarnham road and
Grange road (near Rathfarnham Village). Car Park at N 53 17.935; W
006 17.032</p>
<p>Public Transport: Buses: 16, 16A from City Centre. 47, 47A, 47B
from Hawkins Street, 17 (Blackrock - Rialto), 75 (Dun Laoghaire -
Tallaght).</p>
<p>The castle came under siege during the 1641 rebellion. The
British Civil War began in 1642 and Parliamentary troops were
stationed at the castle. It has also been reported that Cromwell
held council in the castle before going on his Irish campaigns.</p>
<p>The castle was passed down the centuries to the descendants of
Dr. Dudley Loftus until it came into the hands of Philip Wharton.
This young man spent his inheritance recklessly and in 1724, the
castle was sold to William Connolly (who later built Castletown
House - he was also the one who was responsible for the building of
the Hell Fire Club).</p>
<p>Rathfarnham Castle remained in the hands of the Connolly family
until 1742 where it was then sold to Bishop Hadley. It stayed in
his family until 1763, when the Loftus family regained possession.
The Loftus family constructed another entrance for the castle in
the form of a Triumphal Arch, which can still be viewed from nearby
Dodder Park Road.</p>
<p>In 1812, the Loftus family left the castle again when they moved
to Loftus Hall, Wexford. The castle then went through the hands of
many families before being acquired by property developers Bailey
& Gibson in 1912. They used large tracts of land for
construction of houses and a golf course.</p>
<p>In 1913, the Jesuits bought the castle and the remaining land.
In 1985, the castle was sold to Delaware Properties and it was
widely believed that the castle was facing demolition. After public
pressure to save the building, the state purchased it in 1987 and
it was declared a National Monument. The Castle is presented to
visitors as a castle undergoing active conservation. The visitor
can see, at first hand, tantalizing glimpses of layers of the
Castle's earlier existence uncovered during research.</p>
<p>One of the most chilling stories about Rathfarnham Castle is
that of the skeleton of a woman found in one of the hollow walls on
the middle floor in 1880. It is ascertained that she was there for
over 130 years. It is believed that she was locked into a secret
compartment in one of the rooms during a ball. Two suitors were
arguing over her love and they decided to sort out their
differences by way of a duel. The victor would then rescue the fair
maiden from the wall. But as it happened, both died - one from
drowning and the other from his wounds. The whole affair was
conducted in secret - so the beautiful maiden was left there
entombed in the wall, where she died.</p>
<p>To find the cache, you will need to inspect the frontage of the
castle and the front courtyard, which are both accessible from the
car park – you will not need to walk around the building (although
you can, if you like!).</p>
<p>To complete the cache co-ordinates (N 53 18.??? ; W 006 16.???),
you must do the following :</p>
<p>1. There are some semi-circular windows in the wall above the
café – count the windows and multiply this number by the number of
panes in each window. Multiply your answer by 10. To this figure
you must then add 3 times the number of panes of glass which should
be in one of the lamps standing in the courtyard. Add this figure
to the Castle N co-ordinate at the top of this listing to get the
cache N co-ordinate.</p>
<p>Example N 53 15.867</p>
<p>454 +</p>
<p>Answer N 53 16.231</p>
<p>2. Add together the date the castle was built, the number of
stars on the plaque beside the café door and the number of panes of
glass which should be in one of the courtyard lamps – then divide
this figure by 2, and subtract 1 from the answer. Subtract this
total figure from the last 5 digits of the Castle W co-ordinate at
the top of this listing to get the cache W co-ordinate.</p>
<p>Example W 006 16.235</p>
<p>454 -</p>
<p>Answer W 006 15.781</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-22T19:00:00Z : Write note by Mac Aroni Senior <br />Just a note to say that the cache isn't accessable at the moment. There is restoration work going on. Well, scaffolding and hording up, anyway. Never actually seen any workers! Can't say when or if the work will be finished.</li><li>2010-04-18T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Blue Jay 59 <br />This was an interesting one. 
Found the clues, did our sums, thought we were wrong because of where we were to go, went anyhow. 
Felt we were in the right place, there was the feature, there was the river, but where was the cache? 
Not in the obvious place (well our obvious place anyhow)
there was hording around the feature, but that looks as if it's there a while and the cache has been found lately. 
So, maybe we're blind, or maybe it's been muggled......
We'll keep an eye on it, and maybe if the CO is passing he might have a look .... pretty please? 
anyhow, TFTH
Blue Jay 59 & Toffee Man</li><li>2010-01-23T20:00:00Z : Found it by GreyHair&NoHair <br />Found together with the UKHollands! TFTC!!</li><li>2010-01-23T20:00:00Z : Found it by UKHollands <br />The Kids enjoyed the playground while we solved the new co-ords (with GreyHair&NoHair!). Enjoyed both the castle and the feature we were lead to.....TFTC!</li><li>2009-12-27T20:00:00Z : Found it by Mac Aroni Senior <br />First geo cache attempt so we didn't realise cache location could be up to a 10 minute walk from the starting co-ordinates. However, great fun trying to figure out the co-ordinates of the cache location. Once we had these, it was a fairly easy find. Additional hint was very helpful.</li><li>2008-09-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Find #199

We sat in the coffee shop to work out the clues - had to count the panes in the lamps a couple of times to get that right. We then went for a stroll around the gardens before doing the free tour which was well worth it.

As we approached the final location it was faily obvious to us, especially after what we learnt on the tour and realy cool to see this, although a shame that it's not better kept.

The cache itself was easily found, plastic bag is ripped and filthy. 

This was a really great cache - thank you!
