  <description>Dublin&rsquo;s Phoenix Park is a treasure with more than 1700 acres
of walled parkland just 3km from the centre of the city.
<p>At 707 hectares (1752 acres) is one of the largest enclosed
recreational spaces within any European capital city.<br /></p></description>

<p>Few cities have such a facility on their doorsteps &ndash; it is
more than twice as large as Central Park in New York.</p>
<p>The park was for centuries the property of the King&rsquo;s
representatives in Ireland, used as a Royal hunting park &ndash;
which is why it was enclosed by a wall, to keep the game in.</p>
<p>However it was opened to the public in 1747 and so for more than
250 years has been a favourite playground for generations of
Dubliners.</p>
<p>The park is open all year round, there is no admission charge
and visitors can explore freely.</p>
<p>The cache location is at the entrance on top of Knockmaroon Hill
in an area of the park commonly known as The Furry Glen. However
the cache location is accessible from any entrance point into the
park.</p>
<p>The Furry Glen is located in the south-western corner of the
Park and consists of a beautiful series of walks centred around a
lake. It&rsquo;s a really peaceful oasis with lots of birds, plants
and wildlife.</p>

Edited to add: the stump has been extensively demolished and much of it is reduced to a pile of crumbs.
