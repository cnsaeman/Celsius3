  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by wilf28 <br />Great place for a cache - found it with Stern29 on a pleasant day.

TFTC</li><li>2010-05-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by Stern29 <br />What a great view. Thanks for showing.
To bad that there was not enought time to rest at the water after all.

But the cache needs maintenance immediately. The lid is broken and there was a slug (not a TB slug [;)] inside.
Greetings from Germany and TFTC anyhow</li><li>2010-02-16T20:00:00Z : Found it by redflame1 <br />Found on a lovely sunny afternoon after Glencree Cache [^]

Nice views from the top!
