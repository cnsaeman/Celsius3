We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

After a nice dinner, we went to visit the harbour.
The sun was almost down, so the place was pretty clear of people.

Thanks for this one...
