  <description>It'll make Mary Love's day if you log this cache.</description>
  <long-description>The cache is located in the not so pretty and not so manicured end of Santry Woods. The park may be accessed from the Coolock Lane/Swords Raod junction or from the other end; turning off at the Topaz filling station on the Ballymun Road and taking the next left.</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by photomaniac99 <br />Last minute find! Nearly gave up but not abra123cadabra. 
Just made it back to the car before the gates of the park where closed. </li><li>2010-05-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by abra123cadabra <br />With limited time at hand (park closes at 8pm in May) we almost gave up when I spotted the cache. It was where we thought it would be, just a few centimetres away. GPSr didn't really know where GZ should be but the likely hiding place was quickly identified. It definitely made our day.</li><li>2010-05-19T19:00:00Z : Found it by evosheas <br />There you go Mary, logged by an Aussie. Cheers.</li><li>2010-05-15T19:00:00Z : Found it by WeeBookWorm <br />Found when out with my dad (Frezeluberz), gilliancclarke (and her two geo-sprogs) & Zoe andDaddy
