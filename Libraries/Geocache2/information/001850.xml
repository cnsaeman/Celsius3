  <long-description><p>Overlooking Dublin city from the south west, at an altitude of
383m (1264ft), is a foreboding ruined hunting lodge, marked on
Ordnance Survey maps as the 'Hell-Fire Club'.</p>
<p>Current urban lore insists on telling us that it was - and still
is - a site commonly used for the practice of 'Satanism' and other
occult activities, and that the Devil himself made a brief
appearance there at some unspecified time in the past.</p>
<p>In a story similar to the one attached to Loftus Hall (a haunted
house on the Hook Peninsula), a mysterious stranger seeks shelter
on a stormy night, and a card game ensues. A member of the
household drops a card, and sees that below the table, the
otherwise affable and charming visitor has a cloven hoof. Her
screams made the Devil "aware of her discovery, and he at once
vanished in a thunder-clap leaving a brimstone smell behind
him"</p>
<p>Whatever the truth of the matter is, there are great views out
over the greater Dublin area - a good return for the effort put
into the climb!</p>
