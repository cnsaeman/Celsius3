  <long-description>The practice of taking a patient's pulse as a simple way of
detemining their condition was pioneered at the Meath Hospital.
Another innovation was the hypodermic syringe, invented in 1844 -
Francis Rynd performed the first subcutaneous injection by making
four puncture holes in a woman's face and allowing morphine to flow
in through an improvised canula. The practice was improved with the
invention of the plunger syringe in 1853, enabling injection in the
vein against blood pressure.</long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Founded on our way to the hotel.

Thanks for this one...
