This cache is hidden in Howth, on a path less travelled by the
usual throng of people that descend there to enjoy a nice walk on
the piers most weekends.</description>
  <long-description>This location is a far less frequented part of Howth, as not
everybody knows the path is there. The cache is a short walk away
from the carpark near the west pier (the working side of the
harbour with all the shops & restaurants) Enjoy the view on
your walk to the cache and when the tide is out, see if you can
spot the Nessie-like shipwreck! or is it Scotland's Loch Ness
Monster - on vacation? Please log any Nessie sightings and upload
photographic evidence :) Initial Cache Contents: Log, pencil, €2
FTF Prize & 1c(for luck) <span id="ShortDescription"></span>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-09T19:00:00Z : Found it by Suburban cowboy <br />The last one on todays trip to Howth.
We had a couple of minutes left before the DART was leaving so we disided to look for this one as a finale.
Logged with my muggle sister.
And, as the tide was out we even spoted Nessie.
Photo will be uploaded as soon as I get back home... [:)]

Nice views, could only see Nessie's head over the water [:)]
