<br />
This cache is one of a series of caches located in St. Anne's Park
in north Dublin. The park, straddling the suburbs of Clontarf and
Raheny, covers 305 acres, and provides a wide range of facilities,
including football pitches, tennis courts, a golf course, chilren's
play area, boules courts and model car track. There's even a
farmer's market in the "red stables" area of the park every
Saturday. The main avenue, woodland paths, arboretum, rose garden
and walled garden all provide ideal locations for peaceful walks.
<br />
<br />
 The lands for the park were originally acquired by the Guinness
family in the 1830s. Over the next century the lands were developed
into a magnificent estate before being acquired by Dublin
corporation in 1930. While a portion of the estate was transformed
into a moden housing estate, thankfully most was retained as a
public park. For a more detailed history of the park, please read
Joan Ussher Sharkey's "St Anne's - The Story of a Guinness Estate"
(Woodfield Press, 2002). <br />
<br />
Admission to the park is free. Parking can be found at Sybil Hill
Road, James Larkin Road and Mount Prospect Avenue. While the park
is generally a very pleasant place, it's probably best to visit the
park during daylight hours and to make sure you leave no valuables
on display in your car. <br />
<br />
This cache is located in the Rose Gardens area of the park.
Officially opened in 1975, the Rose Gardens have been a centre for
the international rose trials, with the newest unnamed varieties of
roses judged by a jury of local and world experts each year. During
the summer the park hosts a rose festival where the public can
learn more about the flowers and browse through an interesting
crafts fair. <br />
<br />
The cache is located in a small container, about 4cm by 4cm. Please
bring your own pen / pencil to sign the log, as there is none in
the cache. Please replace the cache as you found it,
thanks!</long-description>

The last time they were looking at me a bit funny ... standing there, looking at the same roses again.
