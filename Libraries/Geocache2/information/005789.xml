The series will bring you to stadia, both old and new, of Dublin
city and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the love of
all sport that is alive, not only in this city, but in the country
in general. The various venues are of different ages and sizes.
They are impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities.<br />

<b>Aviva Stadium</b> replaces the old Lansdowne Road stadium.
Landsdowne Road (Irish: B&oacute;thar Lansd&uacute;in) was a sports
stadium in Dublin owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU).
It was used primarily for rugby union, but also for major
association football matches and music concerts. It was demolished
in 2007 to make way for the construction of Aviva Stadium, due to
open in 2010.<br />
<br />
The old stadium had a total capacity of 49,250 with 25,000 seats.
However, competitive international football matches could not use
the entire capacity because the stands at both ends of the ground
(North and South) were standing-only terraces. FIFA and UEFA both
mandate that international matches be played in all-seated
venues.<br />
<br />
<p><br />

align="right" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The stadium is set to be replaced in
August 2010 by the new Aviva 50,000 all-seater soccer and rugby
stadium. All seating in the stadium will be under cover of a roof;
however, the roof does not extend over the pitch. The stadium
consists of a continuous curvilinear shaped stand enclosing all
four sides of the ground. The South, East and West stands have four
tiers of seating for spectators. The bottom and top tiers provide
the main volume of spectator facilities.<br />
<br />
The second tier provides facilities for premium ticket holders and
the third tier provides facilities for corporate boxes. There are
10,000 seats at premium level and a further 1,300 at box level.
Many of these were sold in advance to help finance the overall
project. The North stand comprises one low level seating tier, to
reflect its proximity to the residential properties at that end of
the ground.<br />
<br />
The development of the new stadium was finally announced in January
2004 at a cost of approximately &euro;365 million; of this,
&euro;190 million will come from the Irish government, with the
remainder paid by the IRFU and Football Association of Ireland.
Everything about AVIVA STADIUM, from its architecture to its
environmentally friendly design, has been inspired by the best
ideas around the world to create a truly innovative sporting venue
&ndash; a stadium to be proud of..<br />
<br />
The stadium is situated in the neighbourhood of Ballsbridge in the
city's Dublin 4 area. The stadium has convenient public transport
links as the Lansdowne Road station of the Dublin Area Rapid
Transit rail system is adjacent to the site and passed directly
underneath the West Stand of the old Lansdowne Road stadium.<br />

it, ensuring it is not visible.</p></long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-29T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />Parked near this cache for a nice walk along the Dodder with the dog. Easy find, wet container, dry (and brand-new) log sheet. Thanks, Dara.</li><li>2010-05-26T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by tmob <br />We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Things didn't go well, but the stadium is amazing at night!

Thanks for this one...

1st find of the day. Having had a fab night at the TV Now awards and a stay at the Berkley Court thanks to a TV3 competition Abbey won [:D] we checked out of the hotel at 12:00 and headed to this, our nearest unfound cache [:)]

The stadium looks cool. It looks like a window cleaning nightmare! though with the amount of rain we usually get, i'm sure that won't be a problem. No rain today though! [8D] I found the cache after a brief search. We couldn't sign the log as it was too wet. We tried to open up the log, but it was just disintegrating so we took a photo instead.
