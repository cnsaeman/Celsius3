The map above indicates 5 caches that are virtually "in a row". It
is quite a walk to get all of them but on a summer day it would be
nice. You can of course come back down to the Military Road at many
points along the way and if you decide to do the lot then you would
have a long road walk back to a car. There is a newer car park at
the exit from the mountains at Carrigshouk. With a car parked at
either end a group could manage this quite well.<br />
Duff Hill can be reached from several angles but the one I used was
The Military Rd around Sally Gap. You can park many places. One
ideal spot to "attack" this would be N53 06.334 W006 20.307.<br />
Good sturdy hiking gear would be useful unless there has been a lot
of good weather. Map (Discovery series 56)and compass too as it can
get misty.<br />
