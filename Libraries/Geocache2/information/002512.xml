<b>Donabate Beach</b>
<p>Donabate Beach is a sandy beach 3.4 km long, consisting of a
large sandy dune area which has formed over the last twenty five to
thirty years. There are a number of pedestrian accesses to the
beach.</p>
<p>Anybody wanting to take a stroll further along the beach needs
to be aware that some area's are used by naturists</p>
<b>Island golf club</b>
<p>The Island has a long history attached to it. It was back in the
1880's when four well to do bachelors rowed across the inlet
between Malahide village and "the island" to inspect the territory
and quickly returned to spread the word. Soon, a group of ten local
men clubbed together to lease the land and so was born The Island
Golf Club. The club remained strictly private until after the
Second World War when a lack of finance prompted the move to
membership. The course was only accessible by boat from the
Malahide marina until 1973 and though these days are now gone, what
remains is a traditional, world class links golf course that rivals
the very best in the world.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>To find the cache all you need to do is complete the jigsaw and
get the co-ords from the photo simple !!! beware the flash player
will reset if you take too long !!!!</p>

<p>The cache is a small box with a note book and pencil</p>
<p>As this beach is very popular please be aware of muggles when
rehiding the cache</p>

Can the cache owner please check that it is still working? Thank you.

Update: Thanks for checking the link. I had problems to load the puzzle page because my clever browser had popup-blocker enabled.
Will try to solve this puzzle when I have a lot of time - and I mean probably days. [:)]

I (Ackbar) had solved this puzzle last July but hadn't put together the coordinates to go find the cache until last week with the help of my brother JeePS(Him).

So off we went today to find it. We got parking about 0.2 of a mile from the cache and then had a nice stroll the rest of the way.

It was tough to unearth, as Xenotime log mentioned and the ants are still very much present. I tried to disturb them as little as possible (But they were not happy [V]). We signed the log and re-hid the cache in a way that should allow the next seeker to get it without being Rambo [:)]
