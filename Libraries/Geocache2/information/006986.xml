  <description>The cache is located on the grounds of Dodder Valley Linear Park
with an (unusual) view onto the Great Balrothery Weir at Firhouse.
There are asphalt paths leading to the cache but the last 20 m will
be in a forest (pretty muddy in wet weather!).</description>
  <long-description>Almost 80 m long with a drop of 10 m, Firhouse Weir is an
impressing achievement dating back to Norman times. Since then, the
Dodder river and the weir have supplied Dubliners with water from
the slopes of the Wicklow Mountains.

<p>In the medieval city of Dublin, the river Poddle was giving
enough water but with the growth of population by 13th century, the
amount become insufficient. Two miles long transfer channel (known
as the "City Watercourse") was build to overcome the shortage by
connecting waters of the Dodder with the Poddle. The citizens of
Dublin depended on its supply until 1775.</p>

<p><b>The cache</b> is a 2.6 litre container, so we hope it will
serve well for the exchange of goodies and as a travel bug hotel on
the south side. As a starter kit we put a brain-stimulating
electronic game and mind-wiggling books ;-)</p>
<p><font color="red"><b>Please hide the container exactly as you
found it and make sure it is well camouflaged.</b> Thank you for
adhering to the anti-muggle protection scheme :-)</font></p>
<p><br />
<b>Access by car:</b><br />
 Best from Firhouse Road, turn into Mount Carmel Park. There is
plenty of parking space behind the local pub: N 53 17.218 W 006
19.906.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Access by bike:</b><br />
You can get there from the north of the Dodder, using
pedestrian/bike paths crossing the M50/ Tallagh Road roundabout.
Aim at the middle of the bicycle bridge (N 53 17.467 W 006 19.865),
then when at the end of the path on the western side of the
roundabout, take the (only) way down.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Access by bus:</b><br />
The closest bus stops are serviced by: 65 & 65B (Tallagh Rd.)
and 49, 49A, 74, 75 (Knocklyon Ave.)</p>
<p><font color="green">We hope you will enjoy this place with nice

stroll down the Dodder Valley Linear Park and visit the nearby
Tymon Park too!</font></p></long-description>
