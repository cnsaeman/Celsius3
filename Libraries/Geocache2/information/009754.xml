  <long-description><p align="justify">Great Sugar Loaf isn't the highest peak in the
Wicklow Mts., being only 501 m high, it is one of the most popular
hills . It's the most distinctive mount when looking from Dublin.
It has very steep slopes, and many people think it's an extinct
volcano, because it really looks like a volcano. But it isn't one,
is made of quartzite, which isn't a volcanic rock. In good weather
you can see marvellous view.<br />
<br />
 The best way to get there is from the gap at coordinates N53
08.652 W6 09.305 where you can park your car (or bike). From there
it is 30-45 min walk to the summit. Don't forget hiking boots,
because this peak is very rocky and it is easy to sprinkle your
ankle.<br />
<br />
 The cache is 1 litre steel container, well-hidden about 60 m from
the Sugar Loaf summit. There are some goodies inside and special
FTF prize. Watch for Muggles, because it's quite a busy place
especially at weekends.</p>
