  <long-description>This is a lovely and not so overused park, close to the centre of
Dublin. There is a peaceful stretch of the river Liffey and most
times you can witness boat crews out practising.<br />
The park is at the Phoenix Park end of South Circular Road and can
be reached easily by any means, bus, bicycle, on foot from town or
by car.<br />
 Parking is available at 53 20.751N 006 18.584W which is outside
the park or at 53 20.749N 006 18.806W which will bring you into it.
Be sure to watch for the time this car park closes which is posted
there. In March when this cache was placed the closing time was
4.00 pm.<br />
Go to the South West exit from the Memorial area.<br />
<br />
The cache has been changed to a micro at 21/7/07 and also has been
move up a few feet to escape the water.<br />

  <encoded-hints>Cache has been moved a few feet. It is now about knee height on left as you ascend behind small pointed stone.</encoded-hints>
