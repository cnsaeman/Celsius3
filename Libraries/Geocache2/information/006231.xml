  <logs><ul><li>2010-04-15T19:00:00Z : Found it by Crannyn <br />Found it. Junior Crannyn was on the ball.  In - illuminous arm band.</li><li>2010-03-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by red6t6 <br />We found it!
TFTC</li><li>2010-02-23T20:00:00Z : Found it by slands <br />Second attempt!

After Serapis found it on the same that that I did not find it, I was determined to get back and try again. This time found it easily. No idea how I missed it the last time, as I am sure I looked where I found it! 

As others have noted, the GZ seems to be about 15-20m off - however there are only a couple of possible hiding places it should be fairly obvious where to look. 

No problem rummaging around today, as there was nobody else around on this wet and windy afternoon.

Stephen...</li><li>2010-02-16T20:00:00Z : Found it by Serapis <br />I had some brief business in Dublin today and I got a chance to get a few caches in.
The park was deserted and this was a quick find. TNLNSL. Serapis.
</li><li>2010-02-16T20:00:00Z : Didn't find it by slands <br />Second DNF today :-( Was short on time, so did not get a chance to have a good look. Saw some of the other items lying around the place that others had mentioned, but could not see the cache....the number of people out walking dogs did not help ;-)

This is currently the closest cache to my home that I have not yet found, so I am sure I will be back soon!
