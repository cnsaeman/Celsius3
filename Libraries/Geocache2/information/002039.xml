  <logs><ul><li>2010-03-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by Bootle <br />I figured the puzzle out ages ago but only got a chance to hunt today. Great hidden spot. The forest was really nice, it felt more wild and natural than many of the other nearby forests. I had a real job getting up to the cache as it had been raining earlier and I could get very little grip on the slope. I slid four or five times going up and down - it actually seemed a rather dangerous thing to be attempting in those conditions, but I got there in the end! Thanks for this great cache!</li><li>2010-02-23T20:00:00Z : Found it by slands <br />Solved the puzzle about a week ago - was kicking myself when I realised that it was not really as complicated as I had first thought ;-) The suggested parking spot that Moonshiner Extraordinaire recommended (June 2008) let me know that I was in the right general area. Parked the car, and tried to make directly for the cache - realised quickly that this was not going to work, so backtracked, and headed off along a path to find a route to the cache. After a little scrambling I was there. Some recently fallen trees make approaching the cache from the West (about the only obvious way to approach it) difficult - a little scrambling or crawling required.

GPS went to 0 exactly at the cache site, and after a quick scout around found the cache easily.

Lovely spot, though not too nice this afternoon in with wet snow falling....will definitely be back for a walk around the area soon.
