  <description><p>This cache brings you to Vico Baths, also known as Hawk Cliff
located along Vico Road between Dalkey and Killiney. I have
provided a waypoint for the location of the pathway that leads to
the sea. The cache is located along this path.</p>

  <long-description><p>Bathing areas such as this date from Victorian times and are
found in various places along the Dublin coastline, the most famous
being the Forty Foot in Dun Laoghaire. Many fell into disrepair
from lack of use and/or upkeep. It is nice to know some are well
kept and made use of. Vico Baths is well hidden and is one of
Dublin's best kept secrets. This small nook in the coastline evades
many people as the location is obscure unless you are actually
looking to find it. The pathway to the baths is accessed through a
gap in the wall on Vico Road which you would easily walk by, which
is why I have added a waypoint.</p>
<p>Following the path all the way down you will see a small white
washed shelter and the actual bathing pool. A handrail guides you
down to this area. The cache is a good distance away from the baths
so muggles are less likely to be a problem, however keep a watchful
eye out for them as this can be a busy spot.</p>
<p>Above the bathing area there is a lovely spot with picnic tables
and benches to rest at and simply enjoy the terrific view from this
location.</p>
<p>Due to the steep terrain, exercise caution when making your way
down the pathway. I have set the terrain level to 2 as the cache is
located near the cliff edge.</p>
<p><b>NOTE :</b></p>
<p style="color:red">THERE IS NO NEED TO GO OVER THE RAILINGS TO
RETRIEVE THE CACHE.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to go all the way down to the bathing area
to retrieve the cache, but if you want to explore the area watch
your step near the bottom of the path at the bathing area as the
rocks maybe slippery from the seawater & seaweed.</p>
<p><b>Note re: Parking</b><br />
As there is no parking available at the pathway access point and
the road is quite narrow, it would be best to park on Sorrento Road
and walk the short distance to the pathway access point (waypoint
provided for recommended parking area)</p>
<p>Cache contains FTF badge for the first finder, aswell as a
logbook, pencil, and a few small items.</p></long-description>

Found with jesjes on a lovely walk</li><li>2010-05-14T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />An escape from the office at lunchtime. The sun was beating down and the sea was glistening.
It almost made me wish I had brought my togs and a towel. Almost [;)] !

Yet another great reason for geocaching - an excuse to discover a place that would, otherwise, remained unknown to me.
