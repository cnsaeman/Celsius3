  <long-description><center>A MILLENNIUM-inspired project, which saw the transformation
of the area known as Joe’s Bridge in Lusk, was officially unveiled
in June 2000. The bridge is located about half-mile north of Lusk,
on the way to Skerries and had been hidden for years by hedges,
brambles and long grass. The Tidy Towns Committee, as part of their
continued efforts to improve the approach roads to the village,
decided to tidy up the area and on clearing it, a fine parapet of
dressed stone was discovered.</center>

<br />
 <br />
<br />
<center>With the blessing and co-operation of Fingal County
Council, the committee levelled and grassed the site and river
bank, planted trees and built a rockery. The area was called Joe’s
Bridge after local man, Joe Sweetman, who often used to sit there
some years ago.</center>
<br />
<br />
<center>To commemorate the occasion a stone was laid on the site
with an inscription, but you'll have to visit the site to find out
what it says.</center>
