  <logs><ul><li>2010-02-13T20:00:00Z : Found it by orangetigerprawn <br />This was another of those caches that changes a lot with the seasons. What had been a next to impossible search in the late spring or early summer due to the amount of ground cover became an easier search in the sprse winter vegetation.

 Couldn't find the dates on the monument in the graveyard,- or maybe we were looking at the wrong monument! It was worth the effort anyway. A very kind gentleman brought us on a tour of the church. 
Looking forward to getting back to find it next time!

It was difficult to get parking at the starting co-ords. We found stage one no problem, but the GPSr was 30ft out at stage two. Abbey finally got the point! so we were able to go to stage three. Again our GPSr was only leading us to the general area. We picked a likely candidate for the answer to stage 3, which proved right when we found the cache with our final co-ords.

This cache is for the PT-ABC/123 Challenge.</li><li>2009-03-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by Moonshiner Extraordinaire <br />I had tried to find this cache on 14th October 2005 but, despite ending up in the same place as today, I didn’t find it. Needless to say, I couldn’t find my notes from that attempt, so I collected the required information again today. My GPS went to ‘0’ just 2 metres from where I quickly found the cache (at 12:32) – I’m pretty sure this was exactly the same place my 12XL had brought me before (there’s a subtle change to the cache location, isn’t there?). Took nothing & left nothing. Re-hid carefully – the location is used for other things besides caching. Go raibh maith agat faoi’n taisce seo.

</li><li>2009-01-12T20:00:00Z : Found it by Bootle <br />Hurray! This was my third attempt at this one. The first two times I think I didn't find the correct monument, as the final coordinates sent me well away from where I should have been. A bit of educated guesswork gave me a more logical set of coordinates and today I managed to find the cache easily. Thanks for bringing me here a few times!</li><li>2008-09-27T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Not too overgrown???? Sure, if you ignore the grass and the brambles and everything else! Another chance to experience the goat from hell.</li></ul></logs>
