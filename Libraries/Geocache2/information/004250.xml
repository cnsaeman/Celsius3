  <description>Dublin's first Webcam cache!</description>
  <long-description>This webcam cache is located at the junction of Gardiner Street and
Talbot Street in North Dublin. You will need two people for this
cache, one to visit the site and one to stay in front of a PC to
save a picure of your visit. All you need to do is go to the
coordinates listed above with your GPS and a mobile phone. The best
place is probably the traffic island in the middle of the street.
When you are there, phone your friend who is sitting in front of
the PC. They need to log on to this site -
(<a href="http://www.nci.ie/ispy/cam4.yp" target="_blank">visit
link</a>) Confirm that they can see you with your GPS. Then they
should save the picture by right clicking their mouse and choosing
to "Save Picture As". Confirm that the picture is saved properly
before you leave the spot!. Then log your find and picture here!
<br />
<br />
NOTE: Only photos taken from the webcam will be accepted. Street
level photos will have their logs deleted.</long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

It's always nice to find this webcam caches, well, at least when the camera is still working like this one [:d].
At first we had some doubts to where was the camera pointing, but after a phone call we figured out the right place.
Thanks to our friend [url=http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=9aae07e1-9f38-45e4-bf2d-9129af054cb5]SUp3rFM[/url] for saving the camera picture.

Thanks for this one...
