  <description>Views from Thornton Hall over North Co Dublin and Co Meath.</description>
  <long-description>The cache is located on the northern edge of of Thornton Hall, site of the new prison being built by the Irish Prison Service.

The prison is designed to accommodate approximately 1,400 prisoners, based on single cell occupancy, over a range of facilities all housed behind the 7.2m high security wall. The design has the capacity, if needed in the future, to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in multiple occupancy arrangements. This design feature will future proof the prison in capacity terms for at least the next 50 years.

The prison is due to be operational in Mid-Summer 2011.

The newly planted trees in the general area of the cache are to disguise and camouflage the prison wall.</long-description>
