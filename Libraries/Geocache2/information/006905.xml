  <long-description><p>Raheny is a bustling village with many amenities to avail from
including St. Anne's park, Dublin&rsquo;s second largest park.
There are tennis courts & a par-three golf course in St.
Anne&rsquo;s. Also in Raheny is the major athletics club (Raheny
Shamrocks). There are many more amenities including Raheny library
which carries a range of special interest and community material,
including a fine set of local history files.</p>
<p>On the record since 570AD. Raheny has been the name of this
district for many centuries (it was noted re. 570 A.D. as Rathena).
The name comes from the Irish, Rath Éanna (or Rath Eanaigh),
meaning "the Fort of Éanna". This referred to an old fort in the
middle of the village, which overlooked the stream known as
Skillings Glas (now the Santry River). Traces of the rath have been
found even in recent decades. Éanna was probably a local
chieftain.</p>
<p>St. Assam, the patron saint of Raheny, appears in lists of
saints over the centuries, with a feast day of April 27th, but
detail is lacking.</p>
By 1851, the main village had 49 houses and 295 people
(interestingly, a report of c. fifteen years earlier shows over 600
people, while today the district has over 20,000 people).<br />
<p>The above information was taken from the following website:
www.raheny.com</p>
<b>____________________________________________________________</b>
<p>* There are many places to park within the village within easy
reach of all the stages of the cache.<br />
* The district is served by several bus routes including 29A, 31,
31A, 32, 32A and 32B<br />
* Raheny Dart station is but a stone's throw away from Stage 1 of
the multi-cache</p>
<p><b>There are 7 short stages to this multicache which take you on
a quick roundtrip tour of the village where you'll see some places
of interest & learn interesting facts about Raheny's history.
It should take less than an hour.</b></p>
<p style="color:red"><b>The cache is only available at the
following times:<br />

This note has been added as cachers have been finding it difficult
to locate the cache due to thinking their final co-ords were wrong
