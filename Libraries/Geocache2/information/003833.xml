This cache is one in a series highlighting some of Dublin's finest
examples of Art Deco architecture. The design movement, which was
popular roughly between the two world wars, never had an enormous
impact in Ireland. Nevertheless many beautiful buildings were
constructed along Art Deco lines, and while many have been
demolished, there are still several fine examples to be seen in
modern Dublin. This series of caches will bring you to several
examples, but is not intended to be a comprehensive list. <br />
<br />
The structure of Art Deco is based on mathematical geometric
shapes. It was widely considered to be an eclectic form of elegant
and stylish modernism, being influenced by a variety of sources.
Among them were the so-called "primitive" arts of Africa, Ancient
Egypt, and Aztec Mexico, as well as machine-age or streamline
technology such as modern aviation, electric lighting, the radio,
the ocean liner and the skyscraper. <br />
<br />
Art Deco design influences were expressed in fractionated,
crystalline, faceted forms of decorative Cubism and Futurism. Other
popular themes in Art Deco were trapezoidal, zigzagged, geometric,
and jumbled shapes, which can be seen in many early pieces. These
were the buildings of the future: sleek, geometric, dramatic. With
their cubic forms and zigzag designs, art deco buildings embraced
the machine age. <br />
<br />
 The flats at Townsend street are a fine example of how low cost
housing can be constructed with an eye on style. In the 1930s, City
Housing Architect H A Simms was attracted by Deco and Dutch Moderne
styles for apartment complexes. The resulting corporation flat
complexes that he designed still look good today, especially when
compared to many flat complexes constructed since the 1930s. <br />
 <br />
This cache is a nano. Stealth is required in this urban location,
and please be aware of the many people who pass by this busy
location. <br />
