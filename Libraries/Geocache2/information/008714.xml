  <description>This is a small cache that is starting off with a few little goodies in it. I'm not sure how accurate the co-ordinates are because of the trees, but it shouldn't present too much trouble for the seasoned geocacher!!</description>

TFTC, Merann. </li><li>2010-04-04T19:00:00Z : Found it by tolmaion <br />The search for this cache was easy - but very unpleasant. The park along the Dodder is nice alright but here, among the trees, all you get is cans and other rubbish. I am glad I had gloves with me. I would not have liked to dig around in this dirt with my bare hands. Maybe the owner should consider moving this cache to a slightly nicer location?

#286</li><li>2008-10-11T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Kersti.com <br />Last time we were here there were far too many muggles hanging around. This time we headed here and no-one around. However, the tree cover was a problem and the area is quite lush at the moment so we were unsuccessful - I called it quits when I started to get creepy feelings that maybe I should have got the Hep injections when I had a chance to a few years ago after all. On to the next one.</li></ul></logs>
