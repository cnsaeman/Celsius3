The Howth Cliff Walk offers the walker a fine, varied walk around
an open hillside and the Howth cliffs, with the guarantee of
plentiful bird life, excellent sea views and colourful wild
flowers.<br />
<br />
The walk can be commenced at many different places along the route,
with many easy access points from various car parks that are
conveniently located close to the path. This caching trail
commences at the car park 1km to the east of the village (N53
23.137 W6 03.048) and moves slowly south, then west, but can also
be undertaken in a reverse order.<br />
<br />
While the main walk is generally not very steep, a couple of caches
may require some scrambling up brief stretches of steep terrain. As
always in Ireland it is advised to bring along good waterproof
clothing for the inevitable shower. Sturdy footware is also a must.
If you wish to undertake the entire walk in one go it makes sense
to bring a packed lunch and plenty of liquids, as the full journey
may take in the region of 4-5 hours.<br />
<br />
This cache is located near the end of the cliff walk. You will be
close to a Martello Tower that looks to have been abandoned half
way through some form of restoration, leaving it in an ugly
confused state! Hopefully you will get a good view across Dublin
Bay. From here you can either walk back along the Cliff Path, or
move on to Sutton for several well earned pints!<br />

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-16T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by RoobyDoo <br />From the clue this was the obvious place to look, but again from the clue, the cache has obviously gone.
Lovely walk and views compensated the DNF though.
RD</li><li>2010-06-14T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Gruntplace <br />Too many muggles. Was going to drop off Georgia's Travel Slug but headed for 'Views of Howth' instead. Great views here too</li><li>2010-05-30T19:00:00Z : Found it by didi2206 <br />Took a while to actually put our hands on it.. so small but got it eventually.. what a nice view of the bay, we will do the whole cliff walk soon
TFTC</li><li>2010-05-30T19:00:00Z : Found it by SharpSwords <br />Nice easy find with friends! played in the long grass afterwards and everytime we saw a muggle we would either hide in the grass or shout muggles! It was a nice day and the sun was shining. We had capri-suns and a lot of fun!  [ :D ]  [ ;) ]</li><li>2010-05-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by tmob <br />#2407

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

The first one of this walk series. Great place, this coast line is amazing. We really enjoyed the walk.

Thanks for this one...
Greetings from Portugal</li><li>2008-02-16T20:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />We decided to tackle the cliff walk in reverse order, so this was our first stop for the day. A fairly obvious hide when you're looking for it!
