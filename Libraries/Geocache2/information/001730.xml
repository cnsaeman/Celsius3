  <description>Geocache for Samuel Beckett Bridge, opened December 2009. This
cache is not at the given coordinates; to find it you must solve
the puzzle below.</description>
  <long-description><p>The Samuel Beckett Bridge is the second river crossing of the
Liffey from the Irish Sea. It was designed by Santiago Calatrava,
who also worked on the James Joyce Bridge further upstream. The
bridge itself was floated into position in May 2009, and opened to
traffic in December 2009.</p>
<p>The coordinates are hidden within the clues below. How you solve
them is up to you.</p>

<p style="color:#006600">Temporary adjustment: the cache has moved
a short distance from the above puzzle location. Until I re-create
the puzzle images, take the above solution and add 0.005 north,
0.073 west. Send a message if you'd like confirmation of the final
location.</p>
<p>This is my first geocache; do let me know what you think (too
hard, too easy, too specialised...)</p>
<p>Geochecker link is unnecessary; if you're not certain, then you
don't have the answer.</p>
<p>The cache is a micro container. There's no need to fall into the
river; the cache is safely reachable without going too close to the
water's edge.</p></long-description>

Dickedick from Sweden</li><li>2010-04-10T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by ISU400m <br />Well, without a GPS, it was rather difficult to find. Especially since we didn't know what we were looking for. Oh well, maybe next time we're in Ireland.</li><li>2010-04-03T19:00:00Z : Found it by dottigross <br />Nice puzzle ;-)

TFTC dottigross from Germany</li><li>2010-03-05T20:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />Just love this bridge, so apt for Ireland. 
Found with EdwardsClan on his visit here. Started looking in the original location before reading some more and adjusting for the move!
As for the initial clue, it was eating a millfiore that helped me solve it...
