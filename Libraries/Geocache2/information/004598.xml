  <long-description>This is my first cache and is located just outside Enniskerry
village in Co. Wicklow in a forest called Carrickgollogan. Once you
get to the car park and start your trek the terrain is very good.
When you arrive at the tower you have to walk over some rocks and
some prickley bushes, so be careful if it is wet. Please remember
to replace the rocks.<br />
<br />
The cache is an ammo box. The cache is hidden close to the tower
and will be quite easy to find. The cache is covered by some rocks,
so please be careful and put them back when finished.<br />
<br />
 Some of the road will not be on your base map, so I have the
coordinates of the couple turns you will have to take. I suggest
you print them out and bring them with you.<br />
<br />
 As you come into Enniskerry village take a right. You will be
following the R117. As the top of this hill, take a right just
before the Texaco petrol station. (N53 12.178 W6 10.554) Go 300
meters down the road and take the first left. (N53 12.246 W6
10.255) Go 1 mile up this hill and take the first right at the top.
(N53 13.225 W6 10.208) Keep on driving (or walking) for 285 meters
and the car park is on your left. (N53 13.178 W6 09.963) You are
now on foot (if you were driving); follow the path from the car
park. It's about a 15 min walk to the cache from here. Take the
first turn left off this path, it's about 300 meters ahead of you.
You are heading for the tower. Keep on walking straight, you will
see the tower. Once you are at the tower, it's up to you to find
the cache!! Take a minute or two to enjoy the view from the tower.
Enjoy <br />
 Donnacha.<br />
