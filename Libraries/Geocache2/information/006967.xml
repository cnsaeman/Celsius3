  <long-description><p>Early Days indeed the above location is not the location you
need in order to find this cache.</p>
<p>It was the location for an old cache called “Smooth
Waters”<br />
“you need to jump the wall after the horse and make your way to the
middle of the bridge. Careful, it's a bit prickly where the cache
is.”<br />
there were five finds on the cache with one Cacher being confronted
by the lady of the garden saying it was “private property”</p>
<p>The hint for the cache reads,the ways of every ingenious game
has to out number every finder in very evasive numerals or under go
hard times. Obtaining no effort need over upset great heads to find
it very easy or need ever notice it's numeric efficiency.</p>
<p>Anyway there’s no Jumping walls or horse’s or bridges this time,
it’s just a simple cache and dash.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2009-10-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />Found at last! My previous unsuccessful visit to the location was over a year ago. The puzzle wasn't the hard part; the ivy was! There were a couple of windsurfers packing up while I was searching. When I was walking back along the road one of them asked me if I was geocaching. He said a friend of his does a bit of caching and that's how he knows. Stupidly I didn't ask who his friend was! Anyway I'm glad to be able to cross this one off my list. Thanks, Dara.</li><li>2009-05-04T19:00:00Z : Found it by Donnacha <br />Found while out and about today. This one has been sitting on my desk for a while (like all puzzle caches!) so it's good to get it off it to make room for...erm...another puzzle cache. Thanks.</li><li>2009-01-12T20:00:00Z : Found it by Bootle <br />Success! Each Cache Often Needs Dedication! Today, In Minutes, Eoin Located Unknown Cache! Kool!
