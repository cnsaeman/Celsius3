Cache information: The cache is in a small cylinder with black tape
and its low and clingy. The coordinates are affected somewhat by
large trees so it may be necessary to read the hint or look at the
spoiler photos. It is not absolutely necessary to gain entrance to
the Croppy Park.<br />
<br />
 The Croppy Park This is a very peasant and very small park with a
nice water feature and close to the Luas line, Heuston station (a
fabulous building and a landmark in its own right) and the river
Liffey. The now infamous "Floosy in the Jacuzzi" a reclining water
nymph which up to recently held pride of place in Dublin's premier
street, O'Connell Street, is said to be bound for this little park
in due course. Floosie was replaced by the equally "eccentric"
Dublin Spike and currently resides in St Annes Park in Raheny.
Parkgate street, next to this little park, has the unique
distinction of being the only street on the north side of the
Liffey with a postal code that is even. Collins Barracks, now a
museum, is very close to this park also.<br />
<br />
 THE CROPPIES ACRE<br />
<br />
 The true area associated with this name is about 100 metres along
the quays towards the city centre. It is an unhappy reminder of
some of the tragic history of this country. Many of the freedom
fighters of 1798 that were hanged from various bridges along the
river were dumped in what became known as "The Croppie Grave". It
was a large hole now surrounded by railings as part of the Collins
Barracks Museum and currently closed to the public. After capture
the prisoners hair was cropped, a practice which gave the place its
name. Many of those buried here were put to death on the word of
dubious "gentlemen" and "spies" during the attempt by French forces
to assist the Irish rebels to oust the English from the country.
After the failed attempt, the French were treated royally and
transported to Liverpool and then on to France while the Irish
peasants involved were rounded up and put to death. One of the
saddest parts of this story is that any kind of suspicion of
involvement or peripheral activity resulted in the same fate. It is
thought that more than 300 were buried here and the names of only a
handful remain for posterity to ponder. On the site of the Croppies
Acre, Soyer's Soup kitchen was opened in 1847 during the worst of
the Famine (1845-1847). It was a wooden shack with a door at either
end into which 100 impoverished and starving peasants were shunted
at a time. Bowls and spoons were chained to the floor and each was
given a ration then shunted out. The bowls were quickly rinsed and
the next 100 brought in. It is believed that up to 10,000 people
per day were kept from starvation in this way.</long-description>

It did take us two tries but we found it.

Also in my hunting I put my hand on a manky tissue!</li><li>2010-05-12T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by geotej <br />To much mugglers here!</li><li>2007-08-19T07:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />After tackling a few nearby caches it was time to head home, and this one was on the way so Cam, Toadster and I decided to knock it off before finishing up.

I've often passed this gorgeous patch of green and admired it - should have known there'd be a cache here!

An easy find, especially with the clue which pretty much negates the need for a GPS...
