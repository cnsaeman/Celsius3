<center>Orson Wells terrified America in 1938 with his Halloween
radio play of War Of The Worlds. Even though he was well known for
his radio theatre, people thought it was real and it caused
national panic. They were already nervous with war about to break
out. What convinced them was the way it was broadcast like a news
report. Orson Wells was all innocent at the time, but 20 years
later he admitted it actually was done to scare people, because he
didn't like the fact that people believed everything that came out
of this 'new magic box' called the radio.</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<center>The radio play was based on the H. G. Wells book of the
same name which was published at the end of the 19th century. A
musical version or the War of the Worlds was released by Jeff Wayne
towards the end of the last century.</center>

WIth some help and the the hint I managed to locate the cache though just as it was getting dark. There was an Eastern European nearby collecting all the fallen bits of wood as firewood.

 Found with the usual suspects from the winter madness event. I love the story, have it on CD and have listened  to it i dont know how many times, a true classic, finding the clues to this cache through listening to the story would be great, but unfortunatly it was done with the group who knew where to look.</li><li>2009-10-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by CrazyL200 <br />Found with the rest of the Winter Madness CITO/Camping team.
