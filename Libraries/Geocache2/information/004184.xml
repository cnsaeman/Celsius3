<br />
This cache is one of a series of caches located in St. Anne's Park
in north Dublin. The park, straddling the suburbs of Clontarf and
Raheny, covers 305 acres, and provides a wide range of facilities,
including football pitches, tennis courts, a golf course, chilren's
play area, boules courts and model car track. There's even a
farmer's market in the "red stables" area of the park every
Saturday. The main avenue, woodland paths, arboretum, rose garden
and walled garden all provide ideal locations for peaceful
walks.<br />
<br />
The lands for the park were originally acquired by the Guinness
family in the 1830s. Over the next century the lands were developed
into a magnificent estate before being acquired by Dublin
corporation in 1930. While a portion of the estate was transformed
into a moden housing estate, thankfully most was retained as a
public park. For a more detailed history of the park, please read
Joan Ussher Sharkey's "St Anne's - The Story of a Guinness Estate"
(Woodfield Press, 2002).<br />
<br />
Admission to the park is free. Parking can be found at Sybil Hill
Road, James Larkin Road and Mount Prospect Avenue. While the park
is generally a very pleasant place, it's probably best to visit the
park during daylight hours and to make sure you leave no valuables
on display in your car.<br />
<br />
This cache is located near the "Millenium Arboretum". This 16 arce
area, featuring over 1000 different types of tree, was established
to coincide with Dublin city's "millenium" of 1988. While it's
debatable as to whether the 988 capture of a village that had
already existed for about 150 years really needed a millenium
commemoration, the celebrations 1000 years later nonetheless
brought some brief cheer to a depressed city experiencing high
unemployment. The city centre got the notorious short lived "Anna
Livia" statue, but St Anne's commemoration of the millenium is a
far more attractive and lasting souvenier.<br />
<br />
The approach to the cache can get a big boggy after rain, so bring
waterproof shoes/boots. The cache is located in a small container,
about 4cm by 4cm. Please bring your own pen / pencil to sign the
log, as there is none in the cache. Please replace the cache as you
found it, thanks!</long-description>

A lovely spot for a cache and evidently also a lovely spot for drunken revelry judging by the litter left around.

After finding the cache, which turned out to be larger than suggested, we took out a pin and left TB Street machine Club</li></ul></logs>
