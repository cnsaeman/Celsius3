This cache is located in Marlay Park in south county Dublin. The
park is a great amenity with acres of space to stroll around and
many facilities for all the family to enjoy. Amongst the facilities
provided at Marlay are a nine-hole golf course, a BMX cycle track,
a cricket pitch, tennis courts, 14 football pitches, a childrens'
playground, a walled garden (with Peacocks!) and a model railway.
In recent times, Marlay has become a popular music venue for
concert goers, hosting such renowned international acts as David
Gray, Sting, Van Morrison and R.E.M. Every Saturday the park hosts
a Farmer's Market with many food and craft stalls. The park is also
the start of the 120km Wicklow Way walking trail. Nearby is Saint
Enda's Park, where Padraig Pearse's school is. For some park
history, visit this site (http://www.dlrcoco.ie/parks/marlay.htm).
<br />
<br />
There are two car parks for the park, one at the south end of the
park, off the R113 (College Road), and one at the east side, off
Grange Road. On a fine day the Grange Road car park will fill up
early, so it's advisable to park at the College Road car park. The
cache is in a tupperware box. <br />
<br />
 The park opening hours are - <br />
<br />
 Nov-Jan: 10am-5pm<br />
Feb-Mar: 10am-6pm<br />
Apr: 10am-8pm<br />
May-Aug: 10am-9pm<br />
Sept: 10am-8pm<br />
Oct: 10am-7pm<br />
