  <description>A small puzzle cache around Grand Canal Dock. The cache is not at
the listed coordinates; to find it you must solve the puzzle below.</description>

<p>The Krypton Factor was a popular TV quiz show, in which the
contestants competed to demonstrate their utmost mental agility,
observation, intelligence, and general knowledge to outmanoeuvre
their opponents. If you possess these skills, use them to obtain
the coordinates from the clue below. The location of the final
cache has been hidden using a simple but novel encoding.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-29T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />It took me minutes to solve this puzzle - and weeks to realise that I had solved it! I don't have a particularly large brain, but it was clear why the exact co-ordinates couldn't be encoded in this way. I'm delighted to be second to log this cache. I was so excited yesterday when I realised I had the co-ordinates, that I jumped on a Dublin Bike and cycled directly there after work, only to find I couldn't search because there were some youths hanging around nearby who were friendly enough but curious about what I was doing. I came back this evening with the dog and there was nobody around, so it was a quick find. Thanks for an enjoyable, challenging and ultimately satisfying puzzle.</li><li>2010-04-20T19:00:00Z : Write note by anacreon <br />Congrats to tolmaion for FTF! Apologies for the Geochecker link; I had a typo in one of the digits which would have prevented anyone from getting the right answer. I can see that several correct guesses were attempted but marked wrong, so if this was anyone other than tolmaion then please try again. I've re-created the Geochecker link from scratch and edited the text to make clear that the puzzle solution is the part to check, ignoring any subsequent adjustments. (Geocachers with large brains might deduce why the puzzle doesn't point directly to the cache.)

Seriously, I spent so many hours trying to crack this one. The riddle is just incredible... so many red herrings. I found at least a half dozen ways of turning the numbers into coordinates - all of them looked somewhat plausible; all of them were wrong. In the end, the hint added two days ago made me see the light. I solved the riddle at work today and then headed out to ground zero in the night.

Very interesting spot for a cache. I never knew this was here. It was a bit difficult to get to as I approached the location from an unfortunate direction and also had my bike with me. But after reaching 12 meters east of the cache coordinates, I knew exactly what I was looking for. Easy :). At 2:53am on 20th April 2010, the Krypton Factor was finally uncovered.

The one thing that did not work for me was Geochecker. I put in the coordinates I got from the riddle - no joy. Maybe I should have put in the coordinates adjusted by 12 meters? I never tried that.
