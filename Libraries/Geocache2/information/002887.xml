  <long-description>Sidetracked-Coolmine

The cache is a small quirky container at my nearest local commuter station along the Western Line. Quick and easy and parking is not a problem, if you are quick.
The nearby level crossing is the bane of my life as I often have to wait for as many as THREE trains to pass just to go and buy a lotto ticket.

Coolmine railway station serves Coolmine, County Dublin, Ireland.

It lies on the Dublin to Longford commuter route[1]. A large car park is located next to the station, making it a popular park and ride location. Western Commuter services to both Pearse Station and Docklands call at the station.

The station was opened on 2 July 1990.[1], along with Broombridge, Castleknock, and Leixlip Confey. Like the latter three of these stations it underwent an upgrade project in 2000 which led to the portacabin booking office being replaced by a permanent station building and the platforms being lengthened.</long-description>
