<p>"Dublin can be Heaven, with coffee at eleven,<br>
and a stroll in Stephen's Green".......<br>
Lovely centre city park for a visitor and the stages of this cache
will show you very quickly around.<br>
In spring and summer time it is open for lengthy periods and the
plant life and floral displays can be pretty special.<br>
N.B Any early morning visit would be a good idea!!! And preferably
on a weekday as the park can be quite crowded at weekends<br>
<br>
The coords bring you to an information board where you will quickly
find the locations of the 3 clues to the coords for the cache. Very
close to the cache is another information board with all the
history of "The Green" you may wish to know.<br>
<br>
1. How many figures (excluding the dog) are displayed behind the
Wolfe Tone Memorial? Answer goes where the question mark is. The
rest of the missing coords are in the next 2 questions.<br>
<br>
N 53 20.?-- W 006 15.---<br>
<br>
2. On the back of James Joyce's collar M. Fitzgibbon's year is
displayed. Divide it by 2 then subtract 391 and fill in the 3
question marks below.<br>
<br>
N 53 20.--- W 006 15.???<br>
<br>
3. Robert Emmet died in 18?3. This figure is used twice in the
remaining missing coords.<br>
<br>
N 53 20.-?? W 006 15---<br>
<br>
Now you have the coords for the cache which is quite small so try
not to bring anything chunky to place in it. It is in a small flat
tupperware box in a ziploc bag. Spoiler picture included. The green
liner is now gone so you are looking for a see through tupperware
box with a green lid. This is to help anyone who finds the tree
cover interfering with the coords.</p></long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-12T19:00:00Z : Found it by pierrit <br />Nice cache.
10:25</li><li>2010-06-07T19:00:00Z : Found it by de Bontjes <br />Nice walk around the park. Together with 4-voeters we made a mistake and discovered that the coords were not correct. With the help of the discription and the hints we were able to locate the cache anyway.
It was extremely busy at this bank holliday. There was a mini marathon for women going on and that brought a lot of people to this area. Everyone, including us, had a lot of fun.
