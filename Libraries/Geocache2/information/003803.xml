  <long-description><p>Start from Tibradden car park (N53 14.567 W006 17.684) Follow
the track and trail upwards to N 53 14.320 W 006 16.824, which is
the location of the grave referre to in the cache name. Remains and
Bronze-age vessel were found here in 1849, and a "passage grave"
erected on the spot. Whether the new edifice was built on the site
of an older grave is not known, hence the misgivings in the cache
name.</p>
<p>Whatever the date of the earliest tomb on Tibradden, genuine
passage graves from the 3rd millenium BC stand on several adjacent
mountain tops - Newgrange can be seen on a clear day (the bearing
is just over the Papal Cross in the Phoenix Park).</p>
The cache is just South of East when viewed from the centre of the
grave.<br>
<br>
<p><b>The cache is not hidden in the passage grave - please do not
disturb the stones in the vicinity of the grave!</b></p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-13T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by slands <br />Took a "wong turn" on the way up, and ended up having to scramble over some very rough ground and up some rocks. Should have followed the yellow man [:)]

As a result of the wrong turn, and the now very wet weather I arrived at the grave soaked to the skin, and with very little time - my car was in the car park which was due to close at 5pm, and I was not sure how long it would take me to walk back down the "proper" path. 

Had a look at the grave, and then had a quick look for the cache, but I could barely see with the driving rain on my glasses, so decided to abandon the search and come back another day.

Even though I did not find it, and despite the weather, I enjoyed the walk, so will definitely be back soon to find it.

Worth it for the views alone! We saw 5 bouncing deer - awesome!!  Great Cache- thanks Hezekiah!</li><li>2010-03-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by Bootle <br />Great spot, well worthy of a visit from any cacher who has not yet done so. I walked up from Mossy and LOVED the trek. The new mountain path is great. Along the way I saw seven deer in a group who were startled to see me approaching. Afterwards I enjoyed the great views of Dublin, Three Rock and down into Wicklow. I'd love to come back and do more of this walk. TFTC!</li></ul></logs>
