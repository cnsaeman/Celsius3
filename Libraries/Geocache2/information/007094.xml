  <long-description><p><b>The Sea Weed Wars</b></p>
<p><b>Shenick Island</b> is the largest of the islands of Skerries
and can be approached on foot at Low tide. It gets its name from
the Irish ''Sionnach,'' meaning a Fox. Standing at one end of the
island is a Martello tower.</p>
<p>In 1878, a ''war'' began between the farmers of Rush and the
Landlord of Skerries, Ian Hamilton. The farmers had long gathered
Seaweed, which grew plentifully around Shenick Island and was known
Locally as ''woar,'' to use as a fertilizer for their crops.
Hamilton was trying to impose a payment for each load of seaweed.
To enforce this he built a wall to prevent the farmers reaching the
Shore and blocked their route out to the island. The Rush men
Retaliated by breaking down the wall. This began a legal battle,
Which lasted until 1896, and it was fought with great bitterness
Both in the courts and on the ground.</p>
<p>Hamilton claimed ownership of the shore and the islands because
Letters patent, [documents from the government giving ownership],
Were granted to the Earl of Thomond, from whom the Hamilton family
Had bought lands of Skerries in 1721. The Rush men claimed that the
Shore was owned by the monarch on behalf of the people. The case
Dragged on for nearly twenty years and Hamilton eventually won it
In 1896. From that date the farmers had to pay one shilling, 6ct in
Today’s money, for each load of seaweed. This payment lasted until
1946, when the seaweed war, was almost a forgotten memory</p>

<p><b>WARNING!</b></p></div>
<p>You need to check local tide times for parts of this cache.
Access to the coast is only available at Loughshinny or Skerries.
Please do not attempt to access the coast from the road between
these two places as you would have to cross private land and there
would also be some dangerous scrambling involved.</p>

<p>Walking boots are a must and you may need wellies as well as

<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>To find this cache you will need to do the following:</p>
<p><b>Part one</b></p>
<p>At the above coordinates in the year that Hamilton died 18??
Take these two numbers and place a zero after them to form ABC.</p>
<p>How many years did he represent this county ?? Place a “3” after
these two numbers to form DEF.</p>
<p>Coordinates for part 2 of this cache are N53 33.ABC W006
05.DEF.</p>
<p><b>Part Two</b></p>
<p>The second half of the coordinates for the final cache are in a
micro at this location. The first half is N53 34.269</p>
<br />
<br />
<p><b>If you wish to find the two other local caches in this series
you will need to take careful note of the code provided in the
final cache.</b></p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-23T19:00:00Z : Found it by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Great cache!

I did the first part of this a few months back but decided to wait for some decent weather and make a day of it. Couldn't have asked for a better day! 

Lots of sunburn, nettle stings and bramble scrapes but well worth it. The Seagulls were not too happy with us as we were walking fairly close to their eggs but I think they soon realised that it wasn't their treasure that we were seeking!

Thanks to Windsockers for a fantastic cache.

</li><li>2009-12-20T20:00:00Z : Write note by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Stopped off to get the info for the 2nd stage whilst I was in the area... Looking forward to the rest of it!</li><li>2008-07-27T19:00:00Z : Found it by EnigmaFish <br />this is - so far - my favourite cache! 
I was dying to go back to work that Monday, hoping someone would ask me, "So, did you do anything exciting this weekend?" so I could answer
"Yes, I had a proper adventure! I waded over to an island in waist high water to look for buried treasure! And when we got to the island, I had to fight my way (in shorts) through nettles and brambles! But we found the treasure in the end!"

That was so much fun. I felt like a pirate!

Oh, also, I didn't take or leave anything at the cache but I did take a new little friend home with me... 
On 3 June 2006, 150,000 yellow rubber ducks were put in the Liffey for a race to win money for Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.
On 27 July 2008, I found one lonely little duck, bleached white and sticky, waiting for me on the beach on Shenick Island...All the more remarkable when you consider that "The majority of the ducks were removed from the water at the race's conclusion by a fishing net and are being held in storage for the next Duck Race."

The weather was perfect, and the walk through the water was really pleasant. I wore some wetsuit booties, which perhaps wasn't the best thing to be wearing once I got to the island. The walk to the cache is pretty much the hardest thing about the cache. It's really overgrown, and full of nettles and brambles. I'd recommend going along the beach, which we did on the way back. 
Found the cache easily - looks like some ants have made it their home. 
This was a lot of fun - thanks!</li><li>2008-06-28T19:00:00Z : Found it by Duchodci <br />Yeeaaah, we have found this amazing cache. I strongly recommend it to all hunters. It was real adventure. We have done with our friends Petr and Kata.
