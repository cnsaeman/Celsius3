This cache is one in a series highlighting some of Dublin's finest
examples of Art Deco architecture. The design movement, which was
popular roughly between the two world wars, never had an enormous
impact in Ireland. Nevertheless many beautiful buildings were
constructed along Art Deco lines, and while many have been
demolished, there are still several fine examples to be seen in
modern Dublin. This series of caches will bring you to several
examples, but is not intended to be a comprehensive list. <br />
<br />
The structure of Art Deco is based on mathematical geometric
shapes. It was widely considered to be an eclectic form of elegant
and stylish modernism, being influenced by a variety of sources.
Among them were the so-called "primitive" arts of Africa, Ancient
Egypt, and Aztec Mexico, as well as machine-age or streamline
technology such as modern aviation, electric lighting, the radio,
the ocean liner and the skyscraper. <br />
<br />
Art Deco design influences were expressed in fractionated,
crystalline, faceted forms of decorative Cubism and Futurism. Other
popular themes in Art Deco were trapezoidal, zigzagged, geometric,
and jumbled shapes, which can be seen in many early pieces. These
were the buildings of the future: sleek, geometric, dramatic. With
their cubic forms and zigzag designs, art deco buildings embraced
the machine age. <br />
<br />
Built in 1932, Kodak Ireland used this building as their warehouse
to supply the photographic needs of the Irish market for many
years. The building was then painted a dark cream in colour, not
their trademark yellow colour. The building has an American look to
it which makes it quite distinctive amongst all its redbrick and
Georgian neighbours!<br />
<br />
Rathmines also houses another distinctive Art Deco building in its
impressive Post Office, further up the road at N53 19.281 W6
15.946. <br />
<br />
This cache is a nano. Stealth is required in this urban location,
and please be aware of the many people who pass by this busy spot.

TFTC GudrunXY</li><li>2010-05-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by Dragonfly57 <br />Great building. Got fed up waiting for the guy on his mobile to go so just went for it. TFTC</li><li>2010-05-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by The Who <br />Had to wait to pounce on this one as a couple of muggles were using those damn infernal mobile phones whilst wandering up and down the street. At least it gave us time to look at the very interesting Art Deco Kodak Building. TFTC.</li><li>2010-05-25T19:00:00Z : Found it by tmob <br />#2416

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Founded at night, on our way back to the hotel, the last one.

Thanks for this one...
