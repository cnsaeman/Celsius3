  <long-description>Royal Canal Way-Shackletons This cache is a decon container placed
to the side of the towpath approaching an area where a new train
station is to be built. The car park is already prepared and when
building gets back to some kind of normal footing in Ireland the
city will, no doubt, spread more in this direction. The stone piers
of the old raliway line that existed from this point to Navan can
be seen on both banks close to where the new station is being
prepared. The ambitious notion is that this line will again be
resurrected and that one day this whole area will "blossom" into a
new suburbia! The green fields on the opposite side of the canal
belong to the Shackleton family, made famous by Ernest Shackleton
the intrepid explorer. Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton CVO OBE, (15
February 1874 – 5 January 1922) was an Anglo-Irish explorer who was
one of the principal figures of the period known as the Heroic Age
of Antarctic Exploration. His first experience of the polar regions
was as third officer on Captain Scott’s Discovery Expedition,
1901–04, from which he was sent home early on health grounds.
Determined to make amends for this perceived personal failure, he
returned to Antarctica in 1907 as leader of the Nimrod Expedition.
In January 1909 he and three companions made a southern march which
established a record Farthest South latitude at 88°23'S, 97
geographical miles (114 statute miles, 190 km) from the South Pole,
by far the closest convergence on either Pole in exploration
history up to that time. For this achievement, Shackleton was
knighted by King Edward VII on his return home. After the race to
the South Pole ended in 1912 with Roald Amundsen's conquest,
Shackleton turned his attention to what he said was the one
remaining great object of Antarctic journeying—the crossing of the
continent from sea to sea, via the pole. To this end he made
preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic
Expedition, 1914–17. Disaster struck this expedition when its ship,
Endurance, was trapped in pack ice and slowly crushed, before the
shore parties could be landed. There followed a sequence of
exploits, and an ultimate escape with no lives lost, that would
eventually assure Shackleton's heroic status, although this was not
immediately evident. In 1921 he went back to the Antarctic with the
Shackleton-Rowett Expedition, intending to carry out a programme of
scientific and survey activities. Before the expedition could begin
this work Shackleton died of a heart attack while his ship, Quest,
was moored in South Georgia. At his wife's request he was buried
there. Away from his expeditions, Shackleton's life was generally
restless and unfulfilled. In his search for rapid pathways to
wealth and security he launched many business ventures and other
money-making schemes, none of which prospered. His financial
affairs were generally muddled; when he died, he owed over £40,000
(more than £1.5 million in 2008 terms). On his death he was lauded
in the press, but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the
heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many
decades. At the end of the 20th century Shackleton was
"rediscovered",[3] and rapidly became a cult figure, a role model
for leadership as one who, in extreme circumstances, kept his team
together to accomplish a survival story which polar historian
Stephanie Barczewski describes as "incredible". <br />
<br />
The Royal Canal<br />
Work commenced in 1790 and lasted 27 years before finally reaching
the Shannon in 1817, at a total cost of £1,421,954[1]. The canal
passes through Maynooth, Enfield and Mullingar and has a spur to
Longford. The total length of the main navigation is 145 km (90
mi), and the system has 46 locks. There is one main feeder (from
Lough Owel), which enters the canal at Mullingar. At the Dublin
end, the canal once reached the Liffey through a wide sequence of
dock and locks at Spencer Dock, with a final sea lock to manage
access to the river and sea, but these are no longer fully
operational, and access to the river is especially challenging.
Quaternion plaque on Brougham (Broom) Bridge, Dublin In 1843, while
walking with his wife along the Royal Canal, Sir William Rowan
Hamilton realized the formula for quaternions and carved his
initial thoughts into a stone on the Brougham Bridge over the
canal. The canal is notable in that the Dublin - Mullingar railway
line was built alongside the canal for much of the distance. The
meandering route of the canal ensures a speed limiting curvature
for the railway. The canal was bought by the Midland Great Western
Railway to provide a route to the West of Ireland, originally
planning to close the canal and build the railway along its bed.
The canal travels across one of the major junctions on the M50/N3
in a specially constructed aqueduct. Today Waterways Ireland is
responsible for the canal. It is currently being repaired, and it
is intended to reopen it for navigation of its full length (from
the Shannon Navigation to Dublin) by the middle of 2008. In early
2007, it is possible to go from Dublin to Ballymahon, and boats of
up to 22.9m x 4.0m x 1.2m are allowed. Access points currently
exist near Leixlip and at Maynooth, Enfield, Thomastown, Mullingar,
Ballinea Bridge and Ballynacargy. In 2006 a commemoration marker
was erected at Piper's Boreen, Mullingar, to mark the 200 years
since the canal reached Mullingar in 1806. This cache is part of a
series placed along the Royal Canal Way. The series follows the
towpaths along the Royal Canal heading westwards towards the
Shannon River. There are a number of caches in the Dublin region
stretching from the city centre out into the country. Except for
the first two centre city caches all of these, and any clues or
hints take you in the direction against the water flow. To get the
full benefit of this series I would suggest that it is best done on
foot or on a bicycle though most of the caches may also be accessed
by car. I have to say that the car option will take considerable
time, petrol and nausea inducing traffic frustration not to mention
considerable difficulty with parking. During winter or wet
conditions hiking boots or good waterproof shoes will be required
as the canal towpath can become very sloppy and almost impossible
in one or two spots. ""BE AWARE OF THE DANGER AND THE SLIPPY MUD
CLOSE TO THE WATER AT ALL TIMES PLEASE"" There area number of
Sidetrack caches at the railway stations along the canal walk. A
small detour at these points will bring you to each one.</long-description>
