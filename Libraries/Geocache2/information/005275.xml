This cache is one of six in the "Dublin's Railway Termini" series.
The full series, consisting of Westland Row, Amiens Street,
Kingsbridge, North Wall, Broadstone and Harcourt Street will bring
you to the railway termini, both past and present, of Dublin city
and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the vast railway
network that once served the city. Today the railway buildings
remain as impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities. While some of the buildings remain in use
as railway stations, others are sadly neglected relics of Dublin's
railway past. <br />
<br />
On each cache you will find 2 numbers printed. Gather all 12
numbers and you will be able to ascertain the coordinates for an
exclusive 7th cache relating to Dublin's railway history. NOTE: for
this cache the numbers are on the <i>outside</i> of the cache
container<br />
<br />
Built in 1859 as a railway terminus, Harcourt Street Station was in
use for almost exactly 100 years closing in 1959. A monumental
design on a plinth of steps, with a central monumental arched
flanked by two colonnades of columns - the original platforms were
at first floor level as the railway line was built on an
embankment. The station design is characterised by large simple
details such as the cobells 'supporting' the central portico above
the paired columns. <br />
<br />
Beneath the station shed are excellent arched vaults originally
designed as a bonded spirit store and now housing a wine merchants
and one of Dublin's trendiest nightspots. The main front part of
the building has recently been renovated and cleaned and is now an
enormous bar which looks and feels bigger that the external
dimensions of the station would suggest. The bar design manages to
be sympathetic to the original design suggesting a large
'Gentleman's Club' of the Victorian era without descending to
pastiche. It is worth having a look inside to try to imagine how
the station looked in its glory days. <br />
<br />
The rear of the station has various store buildings which were
accessible from a raised ramp off Harcourt Road. Due for
redevelopment, these stores are quite large containing many brick
archways from area to area and were used by Dunlop for many years.
<br />
<br />
A famous incident in the station's history occured on February 14
1900, when a train from Enniscorthy failed to stop and went through
the buffers and the wall of the station, sending debris over Hatch
Street. Nobody was killed, though the driver, William Hyland,
suffered some injuries. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The cache is a nano. Please replace it as you found it, ensuring it
is not visible. Beware of possible watching eyes in this area.

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

Even at night, there were lots of people in the area. The building is very pretty.

Thanks for this one...
