<img src='http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif'
     border="0" align="middle" />. Trinity College campus is closed
     at night time, but the closing time is very late. The Front
     Gate (N 53° 20.668 W 006° 15.550) is open 7.00 - 0.00 at
     weekdays and 8.00 - 18.00 at weekends and bank holidays. There
     is a 2nd gate at Nassau Street (N 53° 20.585 W 006° 15.465)
     open until midnight at weekends (except Bank Holidays) so you
     have got nearly all day for visiting that place. More about
     opening times - click
     <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Maps/access-times.php"
     target="_blank">HERE</a><br />
<br />
At the 1st stage at coordinates N 53° 20.628 W 006° 15.355 (call it
<b>X</b>) you will see an interesting golden sculpture. You have to
find a nearby granite slab with carved description of this
sculpture. Note the six digits of dates there and call it
<b>ABCD/EF</b>. The distance to the next stage (call it <b>Y</b>)
is <b>K meters</b> and direction (azimuth) <b>L degrees</b> from
point <b>X</b>, where:<br />
<br />
 <b>K = (A+F) (C-D) (D+D)<br />
L = D (B-D) E</b><br />
<br />
 At stage 2 (point <b>Y</b>) you will see another sculpture and
plaque nearby. You have to find a four digit date; call it GHIJ.
The next stage (call it <b>Z</b>) is <b>M degrees</b> direction
from point <b>X</b> and <b>N degrees</b> direction from point
<b>Y</b>, where:<br />
<br />
 <b>M = (H-I) (G+J) (D+F)<br />
N = (J-G) (D*F*I)</b><br />
<br />
 At stage 3 (point <b>Z</b>) you will see one more sculpture and
this time you have to find well hidden (by me) information for the
final stage. It may be a little bit of searching, you will see why.
The information includes three numbers - distance from point
<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Z</b> to final cache (<b>Q</b>).<br />
<br />
 All calculations may include small errors as the degrees do not
include decimal places, and final coordinates will accumulate all
the errors, but using the hint you should find it without any
problems. The final cache is accessible 24/7. The cache contains
the logbook and a pencil.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />Finally found it today. It took me several visits to Stage 3 (Z) to find the well-hidden co-ordinates. Although Stage 3 had caused me much frustration, when I finally found it I was very impressed with the hide.

Two weeks later I got around to going to the final location. I love the way the different locations are united by the same theme. A bit like the "Ancient Symbol" cache, which makes me think the cache owner has a real talent for noticing aspects of the city, that the rest of us just pass by. It takes a lot of thought and work to create a cache like this one.</li><li>2010-05-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by olstad <br />Signed as tsoo together with pstray, enjoyed the mystery.</li><li>2010-05-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by pstray <br />@10:17 #567

One of the best mysterycaches I have solved [:D].  Really liked the theme through the points, and especially the location of the hint on Z [:)].  Thanks for a nice walk around the city and for showing me some parts of Dublin that I probably wouldn't have seen without this cache.  Took a few days, but well worth it.</li><li>2010-04-04T19:00:00Z : Found it by Knight&Fox <br />Phew! What an effort! Not only did our calculations take us directly to the wrong sculpture (where we subsequently spent an hour searching for non-existent information) but, having reworked our answer and finding GZ, we managed to fling the logbook into the unreachable... Eventually retrieved the logbook with no harm done and we were very happy to sign! Very entertaining cache, thank you!

 - Knight&Fox</li><li>2010-04-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by kallerobs <br />Really nice and tricky little task, lots of fun included! Stage 1 and 2 were easy to find, Stage 3 really took a while and I almost called the court for human rights [:D], Right before giving up the little nasty beast showed up. Really nice hide, congratulations. Calculations for final only 16m off. Nice cache with lots of walking, in my eyes a bit too far, but perfect for cyclists. TFTC! </li></ul></logs>
