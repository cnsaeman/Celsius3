  <description>A microcache hidden in the depths of Killiney hill. This is a
tricky micro hidden in a tricky part of the forest. The road less
travelled so to speak. Please bring your own pen!</description>
  <long-description><img src="http://www.cademuir.net/images/IMG_1001-2.JPG"
     align="left"> 
<p>This park is best known for its quarries, green fields, forest
paths, telegraph tower and obelisk. But that is only half the hill.
Another large portion is covered by impenetrable gorse bushes which
have frustrated a couple of would be caches on the hill (and
destroyed one)! However on the southern side of Killiney hill there
is quite a dense deciduous forest. There are a couple of walked
paths through it but that’s about it, people mainly stick to the
main park and leave this area undisturbed. The smaller paths are
just animal trails. With a lot of patience there are foxes,
rabbits, badgers and squirrels to be seen in this forest.</p>
<p>You can get a DART train to Dalkey station if you want to use
public transport, alternatively there is parking on the hill at N
53° 16.158 W 6° 6.593. From here I suggest you make your way to N
53° 16.003 W 6° 6.538. From there you will see a path heading up
over granite into the forest...</p>
<p>This path, and I use the word loosely, eventually ends at the
far side of the hill...</p>
<p>Somewhere along this path there is a microcache. There are a lot
of trees which will make GPS reception difficult. You may need to
pause and double back on your track to try to get good GPS
accuracy. But hey! It’s meant to be difficult!</p>
<p>This part of the forest should only be accessed by people who
don’t mind an adventure and tricky forest paths. Boots are advised
since it’s easy to sprain an ankle in just shoes if you are not
careful.</p>
<p>I hope this is difficult enough cache for you!</p>
<br></long-description>
  <encoded-hints>On the path, (and the GPS should put you on the path!) you know you are in the right area if you find a large fallen tree across most of the path, near it are some large granite boulders. Need more help? All the rocks around here should be granite.</encoded-hints>
