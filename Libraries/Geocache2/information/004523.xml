The map above indicates 5 caches that are virtually "in a row". It
is quite a walk to get all of them but on a summer day it would be
nice. You can of course come back down to the Military Road at many
points along the way and if you decide to do the lot then you would
have a long road walk back to a car. There is a newer car park at
the exit from the mountains at Carrigshouk. With a car parked at
either end a group could manage this quite well.<br />
You can park at N53 07.052 W 006 18.110 or at any spot along the
Military Road at the Sally gap area that you can. Not too many
clear trails up to this and the terrain is tough enough. Good water
proof boots are a must and gaiters would be good. Weather very
changeable and clouds can roll in pretty quickly so compass and map
(Discovery Series No. 56) essential. Views are wonderful so well
worth the effort.<br />
Carrigvore is 682 metres above sea level but the climb from the
road is less than half of that. After some trouble getting a fix on
some city park locations because of trees etc. I decided on this
location because it was much easier to get reliable coords. I also
brought a fellow cacher and his GPS to be sure.<br />
The cache is a decontamination box. It is situated in a rock
formation.<br />
Contents of cache:<br />
Log Book pen and pencil<br balloon="" />
<br />
Streamers<br />
Fire extinguisher key ring<br />
GPS batteries<br />
ILAC pen<br />
scissors<br />
Silver Spanish ring<br />
Practice golf ball<br />
coaster<br />
candle<br />
