Cache info:<br>
Like most of the other Liffey caches this is a magnetic micro and
can be located without a GPS fix. You will need to have a pen or
pencil with you. The coordinates above just take you to the area. I
have tried several times to get precise coordinates for the cache
spot but it appears that the large expanse of metal has a strong
effect on the signal so I have increased the difficulty level to
two stars. The most precise coordinates I can achieve can be
ascertained by answering the following:<br>
<br>
Count the steps from the footpath up to the bridge proper on the
southside of the Liffey and call that AB.<br>
Count the steps from the footpath up to the bridge proper on the
northside of the Liffey and call that CD.<br>
<br>
Coordinates are N53 20.758+AB W006 15.799-CD<br>
<br>
PLEASE REPLACE CAREFULLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER WITH THE OPENING
POINTING DOWN. <br>

The Ha’penny Bridge<br>
<br>
San Francisco has The Golden Gate. Venice has Rialto (by the way so
does Dublin!). London has …well London Bridge. One of the single
most emblematic attractions in Dublin is the Ha’penny Bridge!<br>
Up to 1816, the year the Ha'penny Bridge was erected, no other
bridge existed between Essex (Grattan or Capel Street) Bridge and
Carlisle (O'Connell) Bridge.<br>
There was a ferry from the Bagnio Slip (at the bottom of Fownes
Street) operated by one William Walsh. He owned seven leaky ferries
and was under pressure from Dublin Corporation to repair them or
replace them. He baulked at that idea, preferring instead to build
a bridge. His proposal to Dublin Corporation was adopted and he was
allowed in a hundred year lease to charge a halfpenny toll.<br>
 Designed by John Windsor and costing £3,894.7s.11½d., the bridge
was manufactured in Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, the first centre
of iron casting in Britain. Now one of the oldest cast-iron bridges
in the world it was originally named Wellington Bridge, after the
Dublin born duke who had trounced Napoleon. Now called Liffey
Bridge it is more commonly known as the Halfpenny or Ha'penny
Bridge.<br>
<br>
In recent years the boardwalks along the Liffey walls have been
constructed as extra amenities for the citizens of the city.
Unfortunately they have been receiving some bad press lately due to
the commercial activities of some undesirables who sell all kinds
of pharmaceutical cocktails!</long-description>
