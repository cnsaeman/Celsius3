  <long-description>Sidetracked-Clonsilla

Nice easy magnetic. There is no need to enter the station proper or access any platforms.

You are now just about at the western city limits. Newer commuter stations are planned for the outer areas but for now this is the edge of the suburbia. The pleasant Royal Canal Way walk continues its western route toward the Shannon and becomes much more beautifully rural heading into Co Kildare.</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-14T19:00:00Z : Found it by RosMcC <br />Two workmen in a white van were parked right beside the cache. They were engrossed in newspapers, so I got to the cache quickly and took it off to one side to sign the log. When I came back to replace the cache, both men were out of the van and chatting right where I needed to be. I hung about trying to look innocent for five minutes, then finally decided I just looked suspicious, and went over to talk to them. They had never heard of geocaching, so I enlightened them - and they were fascinated ( I think! ). I told them I'd have to kill them if they ever told anyone where this little cache is - I think they were sufficiently terrified to keep the secret! SL Thanks.
