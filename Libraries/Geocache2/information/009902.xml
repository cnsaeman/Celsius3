  <long-description>Sidetracked- Maynooth

Nice easy magnetic! There is no need to enter the station proper or access any platforms.

Modern railway station built to serve the increased commuter traffice from Maynooth to Dublin Connolly. The proportions of the building are slightly ungainly, turning what could have been quite an elegant station into one that feels clumsily executed.</long-description>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-14T19:00:00Z : Found it by RosMcC <br />Quick cache and dash - we too were able to park alongside the cache. The tape has torn and the magnet is coming off - it was still holding the cache in place when I replaced it, but may well come away entirely next time the cache is moved. SL Thanks.</li><li>2010-05-08T19:00:00Z : Found it by merann <br />The station was quiet today so we were able to park right beside cache location. Quick find. SL.
