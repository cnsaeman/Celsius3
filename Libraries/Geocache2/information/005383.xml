  <description>Regular cache in typical Wicklow mountain terrain. About 4km from
parking spot.</description>
  <long-description>Scarr is one of the few summits in Wicklow that doesn’t have a
cache on or near it. That’s basically why I decided to put this one
up there! 
<p>Ar dtus. This cache requires that you hike in the Wicklow
mountains. It is essential that you are well prepared. The day I
placed this cache it was sunny at Lough Dan (Lough Deán) but there
was fog and driving rain at the summit. You will need at least,
good hiking boots, a jacket, the <a href=
"http://www.irishmaps.ie/product/example_ACD.cfm?ProductID=121">Sheet
56 Ordinance Survey Map</a> and a compass, and of course the
ability to use them! Have a look at this <a>Safety Leaflet</a> for
more information. If you plan on taking up hill walking in Ireland
I recommend that you go consider going on a Mountain Skills course,
details are available from the <a href=
"http://www.mountaineering.ie/mci/info/bosinfo.htm">Bord Oiluint
Sleibhe site.</a> Bí Ullamh mar a deirtear na Gasóga!</p>

<i>Scarr on a foggy day. See there <b>is</b> a path!</i></p>
<p>For those driving on the main roads the cache site is best
approached from Roundwood (An Tóchar). Head towards Oldbridge. You
will find some parking spaces at N53 03.372 W 6 16.407 (O 158 019),
there is another parking spot a little further up the road just
past the Scout campsite. The campsite is for scouts only
unfortunately. It is also possible to park at Glenmacnass Waterfall
car park (O 115 028) and approach the cache from the west, though
I’ve never attempted this route.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do this cache, I’ll describe the route
I took to place it. Park at O 158 019. Walk to the end of the
laneway the starts at the carpark. There are several houses and
farms on this laneway, you should not enter any of the farms or
open any gates. As you reach the end of the lane you may find that
you need to open a gate, at this point you will be heading west
with a coniferous forest on your right (as on the OS Map). Remember
to close the gate after you. At the end of the lane you will be in
open upland Wicklow. Head north onto the spur that takes you west
onto Scarr. There is a reasonably defined trak along the Spur. The
cache site is near the summit of Scarr.</p>
<p align="center"><img src=
"http://static.flickr.com/37/98882803_dfbf07abd5.jpg?v=0"><br>
<i>The rainy weather makes the waterfall look impressive,
unfortunately it also makes it harder to see!</i></p>
<p>With the cache found, you may find that you still have some
energy left! In that case head northwest then north from Scarr to
Kanturk Mountain. The ridge walk allows you to see down into the
valley towards Lough Deán, to the west Glenmacnass waterfall
(Gleann Log an Easa) can look spectacular after heavy rain. The
summit of Kanturk can be trick to navigate, but you want to head
west down the spur towards Lough Dan. As you near the Lough you
will notice that there are houses and farms. Please stick to paths
and cross walls and fences at styles only at this point. Access has
been an issue in this popular spot, and you will see signs from
residents regarding routes and access permissions. There are
styles, trails and paths to take to back to the road, please use
them. Once back on the road just walk back the 1.5km or so to your
car and enjoy the views of the Lough.</p>

<i>Lough Deán as seen on the way down from Kanturk</i></p>
<p>This cache is not suited to public transport. There is a
   <a href="http://www.glendaloughbus.com/">bus service</a> that
   serves Laragh (An Láithreach) and Roundwood. However I would
   only recommend this if you were planning on spending a few days
   in the vicinity to visit some more caches on other nearby
   mountains. Bed and Breakfast accommodation is available in
   nearly all villages and there is an excellent hostel in
   Glengalough (Gleann Dá Loch). There are shops in Roundwood and
   Laragh.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the cache and the views. There is a camera in
the cache so please take a pic of yourself! If you find you like
hiking in Wicklow you should check out the other caches on nearby
mountains.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-04-11T19:00:00Z : Found it by Prefontaine <br />Our first cache of the day and the one of the best walks we have had in the Wicklow Mountains. It had everything.....amazing weather, scenery, views and freedom. We spoke to a local farmer before we started our climb who wished us well and gave us some advice on which route to take. The top of the mountain is fantastic due to the views on all four corners. We sat there for a while enjoying our lunch and vast space below us. I was amazed at the amount of walkers out on this route and it appears to be very popular. We headed onto Kanturk and then down to Lough Dan to find another cache.

We will definetly be coming back here as we loved it so much.

Have been up Scarr before but didn't geocache til recently.
Had been to Sugraloaf twice in the last few days having failed both times to find the cache.
Really disappointing especially when it's such a long way up!
 Today was a pleasure.
Your disposable camera is full of photos so I couldn't take one but have one of my own to upload.
Took an alien baby and left a button for Milanos restaurant.
