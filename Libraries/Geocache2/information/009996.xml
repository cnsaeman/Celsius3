  <long-description><p>Located in Ranelagh and extending to 1 hectare (2.47 acres), the
gardens were originally part of 5 hectares of pleasure gardens
developed in 1775 by a businessman who called them after Lord
Ranelagh from Co. Wicklow. Lord Ranelagh had similar pleasure
gardens beside the Thames in London. The first hot air balloon
flight in Ireland was launched from the pleasure gardens by Richard
Crosbie.</p>
<p>The gardens were later sold to a teaching order of nuns and in
1840 the convent there became totally enclosed and the gardens
forgotten. When the lands were developed for housing in the mid
1980's, the current small park was designed to include an
ornamental pool thereby restoring the two-hundred years historical
connection with the original Ranelagh Gardens.</p>
<p>The coordinates above will lead you to the gates of the Gardens
&ndash; there is plenty of disc parking nearby, and the 44 &
48A buses stop less than 50 metres away. The Luas line is also
close by &ndash; in fact, the gateway to the gardens forms a
supporting arch for one of the Luas line bridges.</p>
<p>To move on to the cache location, multiply the number of park
entrances (A) by 5 and add the result to the N coordinates given
above (N53 19.600 + (A*5)) = N53 19.???)</p>
<p>Next, calculate the number of years the Carmelite nuns had a
monastery here &ndash; (BCD). To get the W coordinates, subtract
((A+B)*D) from 006 15.385.</p>
<p>You now have the co-ordinates of the cache location &ndash;
there may be some interference from trees and buildings, so
there&rsquo;s a clue below!</p></long-description>
