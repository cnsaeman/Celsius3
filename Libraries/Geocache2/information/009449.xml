<p><strong>Leopardstown Racecourse</strong></p>
<p>Leopardstown Racecourse is one of Europe's premier racing
venues. Like the majority of Irish courses, it hosts both National
Hunt and Flat racing. Located in county Dublin, a few miles south
of the Dublin city centre. The course was modelled on Sandown Park
Racecourse in England, and is regarded as a true test for any
horse.</p>
<p>Completed in 1888 and acquired by the Horse Racing Board of
Ireland in 1967. Many important races are held here and racing
takes place all year round, with about 22 meetings per year.</p>
<p>The Leopardstown Hall of Fame honours famous Irish horse racing
trainers, jockeys and horses like, Vincent O'Brien, Tom Dreaper,
Pat Taaffe and Pat Eddery, Arkle, Dawn Run, Levmoss and
Nijinsky.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Getting there</strong></p>
<p>Leopardstown is easily accessible by car from either the M50 or
the N11. Parking is available at Stages 1 and 2.<br />
The cache is also accessible by public transport. The easiest way
is to get the Luas Green Line to the Sandyford stop and walk 15
minutes to the Racecourse.</p>
<p><b><font color="red">Please Note: it is recommended you do not
try this cache on a race day. For fixtures, please see

<hr />
<p><strong>The Cache</strong></p>
<p>To find the cache you will need to visit a couple of locations
first.</p>
<p><b>Stage One: N53° 15.892, W006° 11.665</b><br />
 At this location, take note of the name on the three black
lampposts. How many letters are there in this name? Call this
<font color="blue"><b>A</b></font></p>
<p><b>Stage Two: N53° 15.922, W006° 11.703</b><br />
 At this location, find the two years this place won Pub Of the
Year. Take the second year and call it
<font color="blue"><b>BCDE</b></font></p>
<p><b>Stage Three: N53° 15.964, W006° 11.642</b><br />
 At this stage you will see some colourful plastic seats. How many
different colours are there? Call this
<font color="blue"><b>F</b></font></p>
<p><b>Stage Four: N53° 16.062, W006° 11.685</b><br />
 At this stage there is a speed limit sign. What number is on it?
Call this <font color="blue"><b>GH</b></font></p>
<p><b>Stage Five: N53° 16.153, W006° 11.641</b><br />
 At this stage you will see a sign - how many black arrows are
pointing right? Call this <font color="blue"><b>I</b></font></p>
You now have everything you need to find the cache. The cache can
be found at: 
<p>N53°
<b><font color="blue">(A+G+D)xB.(F-E)F(A+G)</font></b><br />
W006° <b><font color="blue">(G+F+B).(E+B)I(C+D)</font></b></p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by Fitzet <br />Like hollmanr, I made a mistake with the Stage 3 calculation.
Great minds think alike, etc.

Once I figured out that the cache was probably not located in someone's garden in Foxrock, I made the change and, with the hint, located the cache.

Had to wait for a single muggle with dog to move out of the area. GPS pointed sraight at location, so was easy find. Took nothing, left nothing
Thanks !</li><li>2010-03-21T19:00:00Z : Found it by Mac Aroni Senior <br />Found on a sunny and very pleasant spring morning. Had a good wander around  enjoying the sunshine. Unfortunately you can no longer walk around the race course. Would have made it even nicer and the dog would have enjoyed that immensely. That has not been possible for the past maybe 6 months, due to the fact that a walker was hit by a golf ball and subsequently sued Leopardstown Race course. So that put a stop to all walkers, joggers etc. And security will stop you, so no point in trying. TFTC. Co-ords spot on.</li><li>2010-02-06T20:00:00Z : Found it by Jumpin Jiminie <br />Had a lovely peaceful stroll around the area for this multi earlier this afternoon, whilst everyone else was running around trying to get everything ready for the Gold Cup tomorrow.

Nachdem ich vor ein paar Wochen am Final gescheitert bin, habe ich ihn heute gut gefunden. Es muss nur intensiv genug gesucht werden.
