<p>The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) is the rail line running
along the coast of Dublin, from Malahide and Howth southwards as
far as Greystones, Co Wicklow.</p>
<p>Side-Tracked Caches are intended to provide quick
cache-and-dashes at train stations.<br />
The Cache is a small micro container - please re-hide it well to
ensure that the commuting muggles don’t discover it.</p>
<p><b>Bring a pen / pencil, as the cache may be too small to hold
one!</b></p></long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

We were lucky, a brand new container for us [:D]

Thanks for this one...

What I did find was some kind of fixture] behind the lower cross bar. [It looked like the cache was there once.
