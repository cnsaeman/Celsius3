Through the mists of dawn;<br />
I look, and the star of the morning<br />
From the sky is gone.<br />
<br />
My love comes down from the mountain,<br />
At dawn, dewy-sweet;<br />
Did you step from the star to the mountain,<br />
O little white feet?<br />
<br />
O whence came your twining tresses<br />
And your shining eyes,<br />
But out of the gold of the morning<br />
And the blue of the skies?<br />
<br />
The misty morning is burning<br />
In the sun&rsquo;s red fire,<br />
And the heart in my breast is burning<br />
And lost in desire.<br />

I follow you into the valley<br />
But no word can I say;<br />
To the East or the West I will follow<br />
Till the dusk of my day.<br />

<br />
A good hike on some of the most popular walking routes in the whole
of the Garden County. The trek shown on the illustration above is
approx 16K in length with a total ascent of just over 1000m. A fair
section of the Wicklow Way is included but also some rougher and
perhaps more interesting terrain.<br />
The route described above takes you from Crone car park at N53
09.897 W006 13.104 and rises toward Maulin using the little white
waymarking signs pinned to the trees (red for coming back down).
These are quite enough to get you to Stage 1 but I am also
including reference coordinates here to make it more clear.
Following the forest track upward to N53 09.865 W006 13.169 you
will see a smaller track on the right heading more directly upward.
Follow this to N53 09.741 W006 13.290 where you should turn right
and walk to N53 09.766 W006 13.402. Here you turn left and walk to
N53 09.707 W006 13.463 and turn right. Then at N53 09.709 W006
13.512 keep left and then straight on at N53 09.725 W006
13.607.<br />
By now you should be able to continue the zig zags upwards by
following the signs and they will lead you to Stage 1 at the
coordinates at the top of the page.<br />
Here you will find 3 numbers which you should call ABC.<br />
<br />
From here you should have climbed a stile and be heading out on to
the mountains. Soon you will have to cross some rough ground to
gain the bog track that will take you along the ridge to Stage
2.<br />
At N53 09.337 W006 15.129 you will find the second set of 3
numbers. Call these DEF. Look for a raised tuft of heather and
please do not remove the item.<br />
<br />
The final cache coordinates near the summit of War Hill will then
be N53 08.ABC W006 15.DEF.<br />
<br />
To get there from Stage Two I strongly recommend that you head in
the direction of the source of the Dargle at N53 09.015 W006
16.255. This would be particularly useful during Summer time when
the heather and ferns can grow thick and high. This will keep you
on high enough ground to make your ascent of War Hill that much
easier.<br />
On the illustration above you will also see a number of other
caches that can be reached by making a very pleasant circular walk
back to Crone using Djouce and the Wicklow Way to get there.<br />
<br />
From Mountain Views:<br />
War Hill Mountain Wicklow County Cnoc an Bhairr A name in Irish
(Language) (Ir. Cnoc an Bhairr [PNCW*], 'hill of the summit')
Height: 686 metres OS 1/50k Mapsheet: 56 for top Grid Ref: O16895
11338 Latitude: 53.140026 Longitude: -6.253961 ITM: 716818 711369
Prominence: 71m Isolation: 1.4km Rating graphic. Price's suggested
Irish derivation for War Hill, whilst possible, seems rather
tautological and is not backed up by any Irish attestations. Barr
is itself a common term denoting a hill and is usually the first
element in names, e.g. Barr Trí gCom (Baurtregaum), Barr na
Coilleadh (Barnakillew), etc. Also "hill of the top" seems a
strange way to describe War Hill, since it's really only a lower
outlier of Djouce. An alternative is that the name was created in
English, and this is supported by a reference to a battle on War
Hill in a letter written on 15th December 1838 by Eugene O'Curry.
&ldquo;In the Townland of Lackandarragh in the Powerscourt Parish
they shew a place called the Churchyard, but it does not retain the
least vestige of either a church or churchyard. Some say that it
was the place of sepulture of persons killed in a battle fought
between the English troops and the O&rsquo;Tooles some three
hundred years ago. This battle was fought on War Hill, immediately
overhanging this Churchyard, on the opposite side of the
river.&rdquo; Of course, one would expect these events to give rise
to "Battle Hill", rather than "War Hill", so this suggestion must
also be considered tentative. War Hill is the 129th highest summit
in Ireland.<br />
Maulin:<br />
Maulin Mountain Wicklow County Málainn A name in Irish (Language)
(Ir. Málainn [PNCW], possibly 'high or sloping ground') Height: 570
metres OS 1/50k Mapsheet: 56 for top Grid Ref: O18437 13106
Latitude: 53.155564 Longitude: -6.230278 ITM: 718360 713136
Prominence: 70m Isolation: 2.3km Rating graphic. Málainn is rare
element of obscure origin and meaning, occurring in a handul of
place-names scattered throughout the country. For origin of name,
see articles by Paul Tempan: "The Element Málainn in Place-names"
in the Kerry Magazine, No. 18, 2008 (15-16) and "An Eilimint
Málainn i Logainmneacha" in the Donegal Annual 2006 (218-19). There
are references in early Irish texts to Málu, site of a battle in
Leinster. This mountain has been proposed as an identification by
Eoin MacNeill (JRSAI lxv, 14), but this is far from certain. Maulin
is the 328th highest summit in Ireland. Our data has reached 76% of
the goal for this summit. (Details)<br />

landowners often generously allow access to upland areas across or

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-12T21:13:08Z : Needs Maintenance by daraconn <br />The waypoint for Stage 2 is wrong by 1 minute - it says 6W14 instead of 6W15. The co-ordinates in the text of the cache description are correct.</li><li>2010-06-12T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />Followed the circular route suggested which made for a nice long walk with three caches that I hadn't found before. Much of the route I had entirely to myself and the dog, an agreeable feeling of solitude after a stressful week at work.

In the past I've had difficulty finding my way on the north side of Maulin - too many tracks, the discovery map is nearly useless. So I really appreciated all the waypoints, and I was delighted to see that there are now signs on the trees showing the way. After Stage 1 we diverted to the summit of Maulin for a break and a bite. Then checked on the Maulin cache before going on to Stage 2.

There's an error in the waypoint of Stage 2 - it is 1 minute (1.11 km) out. This led to some confusion as the Stage 2 waypoint didn't correspond to the map or to the description. It led to a short excursion into the heather before I realised the error and headed to the right place.

Stage 2 is at the top of a hill which is nameless - it seems unfair as it is a perfectly respectable summit and in fact is higher than Maulin. Second time to visit the location and the Dargle source, having done the WITG (Tonduff) a few weeks ago. Down to the Dargle source - I now realise looking at the map you didn't intend we would track all the way to your reference point 7, but should cross the Dargle about a kilometre further east. This makes sense, as the trek to the source and back is significant extra distance and involves a lot of walking through heather and boggy ground.

Finally up to War Hill, a long steep slog to a lovely rounded summit with the beginnings of a stone cairn. I get the impression it's not often visited. It was my first visit. There are deep dark bog pools on the summit and Shiro plunged in for a swim to cool off.</li><li>2010-05-18T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Shailaja <br />Got to stage one coords with Toffee Man and searched high and low but didn't find any three numbers :S

Decided to leave it for another day and headed for the ones on Maulin and Djouce instead.

Shailaja</li><li>2010-05-13T19:00:00Z : Found it by theswerve <br />Found eventuallywhen i made a horlicks of inputting wrong coords for s2...had me 80 odd mtrs from S1...something wrong i said to self as looking at map its about 1k away...found in the end...like the item at S2...so after Tonduff i went for it and found after a little searching...TFTC...</li><li>2010-05-05T19:00:00Z : Found it by didi2206 <br />Well.. that was great but pretty hard going!

Did stage 1 and 2 on Monday - ground was unnaturally dry so do these now before we get our usual drenching!!

Waited til today to do the final stage. Didn't approach from stage 2 though.. went via the Djouce wood car park (I call it the river car park)..
we headed due west toward the shoulder of Djouce where there is a kind of trail.. then directly uphill where there was no trail
It's so dry up top you can skate down the banks of peat and land in what should be a bog pond but is now just beautiful brown stuffing!!! 
Great fun.. came down the north side to the Dargle and followed it back to the bridge and headed home.
managed to lose a set of car keys ( typical) so if anyone's up there pls keep your eyes open!
Thank you for a really enjoyable day to a place I wouldn't normally venture!!</li></ul></logs>

At dawn, dewy-sweet;&lt;br /&gt;
Did you step from the star to the mountain,&lt;br /&gt;
O little white feet?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
O whence came your twining tresses&lt;br /&gt;
And your shining eyes,&lt;br /&gt;
But out of the gold of the morning&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The misty morning is burning&lt;br /&gt;
In the sun&amp;rsquo;s red fire,&lt;br /&gt;

A good hike on some of the most popular walking routes in the whole
of the Garden County. The trek shown on the illustration above is
approx 16K in length with a total ascent of just over 1000m. A fair
section of the Wicklow Way is included but also some rougher and
perhaps more interesting terrain.&lt;br /&gt;
The route described above takes you from Crone car park at N53
09.897 W006 13.104 and rises toward Maulin using the little white
waymarking signs pinned to the trees (red for coming back down).
These are quite enough to get you to Stage 1 but I am also
including reference coordinates here to make it more clear.
Following the forest track upward to N53 09.865 W006 13.169 you
will see a smaller track on the right heading more directly upward.
Follow this to N53 09.741 W006 13.290 where you should turn right
and walk to N53 09.766 W006 13.402. Here you turn left and walk to
N53 09.707 W006 13.463 and turn right. Then at N53 09.709 W006
13.512 keep left and then straight on at N53 09.725 W006
13.607.&lt;br /&gt;
By now you should be able to continue the zig zags upwards by
following the signs and they will lead you to Stage 1 at the
coordinates at the top of the page.&lt;br /&gt;
Here you will find 3 numbers which you should call ABC.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From here you should have climbed a stile and be heading out on to
the mountains. Soon you will have to cross some rough ground to
gain the bog track that will take you along the ridge to Stage
2.&lt;br /&gt;
At N53 09.337 W006 15.129 you will find the second set of 3
numbers. Call these DEF. Look for a raised tuft of heather and
please do not remove the item.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final cache coordinates near the summit of War Hill will then
be N53 08.ABC W006 15.DEF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To get there from Stage Two I strongly recommend that you head in
the direction of the source of the Dargle at N53 09.015 W006
16.255. This would be particularly useful during Summer time when
the heather and ferns can grow thick and high. This will keep you
on high enough ground to make your ascent of War Hill that much
easier.&lt;br /&gt;
On the illustration above you will also see a number of other
caches that can be reached by making a very pleasant circular walk
back to Crone using Djouce and the Wicklow Way to get there.&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Followed the circular route suggested which made for a nice long walk with three caches that I hadn't found before. Much of the route I had entirely to myself and the dog, an agreeable feeling of solitude after a stressful week at work.

In the past I've had difficulty finding my way on the north side of Maulin - too many tracks, the discovery map is nearly useless. So I really appreciated all the waypoints, and I was delighted to see that there are now signs on the trees showing the way. After Stage 1 we diverted to the summit of Maulin for a break and a bite. Then checked on the Maulin cache before going on to Stage 2.

There's an error in the waypoint of Stage 2 - it is 1 minute (1.11 km) out. This led to some confusion as the Stage 2 waypoint didn't correspond to the map or to the description. It led to a short excursion into the heather before I realised the error and headed to the right place.

Stage 2 is at the top of a hill which is nameless - it seems unfair as it is a perfectly respectable summit and in fact is higher than Maulin. Second time to visit the location and the Dargle source, having done the WITG (Tonduff) a few weeks ago. Down to the Dargle source - I now realise looking at the map you didn't intend we would track all the way to your reference point 7, but should cross the Dargle about a kilometre further east. This makes sense, as the trek to the source and back is significant extra distance and involves a lot of walking through heather and boggy ground.

Finally up to War Hill, a long steep slog to a lovely rounded summit with the beginnings of a stone cairn. I get the impression it's not often visited. It was my first visit. There are deep dark bog pools on the summit and Shiro plunged in for a swim to cool off.</groundspeak:text>

Decided to leave it for another day and headed for the ones on Maulin and Djouce instead.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well.. that was great but pretty hard going!

Did stage 1 and 2 on Monday - ground was unnaturally dry so do these now before we get our usual drenching!!

Waited til today to do the final stage. Didn't approach from stage 2 though.. went via the Djouce wood car park (I call it the river car park)..
we headed due west toward the shoulder of Djouce where there is a kind of trail.. then directly uphill where there was no trail
It's so dry up top you can skate down the banks of peat and land in what should be a bog pond but is now just beautiful brown stuffing!!! 
Great fun.. came down the north side to the Dargle and followed it back to the bridge and headed home.
managed to lose a set of car keys ( typical) so if anyone's up there pls keep your eyes open!
Thank you for a really enjoyable day to a place I wouldn't normally venture!!</groundspeak:text>
