This cache is one in a series highlighting some of Dublin's finest
examples of Art Deco architecture. The design movement, which was
popular roughly between the two world wars, never had an enormous
impact in Ireland. Nevertheless many beautiful buildings were
constructed along Art Deco lines, and while many have been
demolished, there are still several fine examples to be seen in
modern Dublin. This series of caches will bring you to several
examples, but is not intended to be a comprehensive list. <br />
<br />
The structure of Art Deco is based on mathematical geometric
shapes. It was widely considered to be an eclectic form of elegant
and stylish modernism, being influenced by a variety of sources.
Among them were the so-called "primitive" arts of Africa, Ancient
Egypt, and Aztec Mexico, as well as machine-age or streamline
technology such as modern aviation, electric lighting, the radio,
the ocean liner and the skyscraper. <br />
<br />
Art Deco design influences were expressed in fractionated,
crystalline, faceted forms of decorative Cubism and Futurism. Other
popular themes in Art Deco were trapezoidal, zigzagged, geometric,
and jumbled shapes, which can be seen in many early pieces. These
were the buildings of the future: sleek, geometric, dramatic. With
their cubic forms and zigzag designs, art deco buildings embraced
the machine age. <br />
<br />
The former Burton's Store on the corner of Dame and South Great
George's Streets is one of the most expressive and exciting facades
in the city. Built between 1928 and 1930, it is a good example of a
restrained art deco building designed by Harry Wilson from Leeds.
<br />
<br />
 Clad in faience tiles and with a wonderfully coloured roof, the
building was in the tradition of Dublin 'corner-turning' buildings
with its similar facades along both streetscapes. Every detail has
been designed to promote Burtons: from the elaborate signage near
the roof to the meticuously detailed air vents (with their Burton's
logo) underneath the main shop windows. The facade is incredibly
detailed with moulded ornamental capitals, window surrounds and
decorative cornice. <br />
<br />
The upper stories are used as office accomodation and bereft of
much of their original detail bar some glass blocks on the
staircases and around doorways. <br />
<br />
This cache is a nano. Stealth is required in this urban location,
and please be aware of the many people who pass by this busy
location. <br />
