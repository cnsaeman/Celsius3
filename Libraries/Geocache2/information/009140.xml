  <long-description>Not a lighthouse, but the internals of one! Housed in the Maritime
Museum - an underfunded and unsung piece of our maritime heritage,
and well worth a visit (except the building is being renovated at
present and will open to visitors again in May 2007. The cache is
outside the perimeter of the building and environs.</long-description>

Paula was navigating - I was driving (on the wrong side of the road) for the first time.  We became lost on the way to the hotel and had no clue where we were and where we needed to be.  Hey, I thought to myself, I loaded a few geocaches near the hotel into my GPS... Well, we were 6.58 miles west of the hotel (don't know how that happened) and we used the caching coordinates to direct us back to the general vicinity.  For a moment, we both had a new appreciation for this hobby of mine and your cache.  "L is for Lighthouse" was a trip saver for us... guiding us back to safety.  

Thanks for the fun and for the guiding light.  TNLNSL.  </li><li>2010-06-10T19:00:00Z : Found it by Martyna <br />first international find while touring this beautiful country found with muggle cousin who humors me. TFTC</li><li>2010-05-26T19:00:00Z : Found it by tmob <br />#2436

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

We were getting hungry, and decided to get dinner in Dun Laoghaire.
We did a small walk to get to know the place a little better, this cache just felt in front of us.

Thanks for this one...

Mongoose said there's one of there, so we might as well go and get it. I luckily put my hand on it. Thank you for the cache.
