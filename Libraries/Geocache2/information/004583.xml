TFTC</li><li>2010-02-13T20:00:00Z : Found it by Kersti.com <br />After finding the Cave so quickly we thought this would be simple. Took us a bit longer to get there than planned as we stopped at the museum, which was pretty good and well worth a visit. Finally headed round to this one and had the cache in hand in record time. Thanks for bringing us to this wonderful park.</li></ul></logs>
