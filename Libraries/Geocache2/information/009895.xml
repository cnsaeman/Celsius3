  <description>Dublin inner city nano.</description>
  <long-description><b>Background:</b><br />
James Connolly, who gives his name to one of Dublin´s major train
stations, was born on June 5, 1868, Edinburgh and died by firing
squad May 12, 1916 in Dublin. <br />
<br />
 Connolly was the first major Marxist union leader in Ireland and
was decisive in bringing about the Easter Rising (April 24–29,
1916) in Dublin against British rule. In 1896, soon after his
arrival in Dublin, Connolly helped found the Irish Socialist
Republican Party. <br />
<br />
<b>The Cache:</b><br />
The cache is a magnetic nano. Please bring your own pen for signing
the log and replace in the same location. Please note that this is
a VERY busy area so stealth is required.<br />
<br />
<b>A Note:</b><br />
There is a *massive* iron bridge right next to the cache location
which may (or may not) interfere with your GPS. The name should
help you no matter how far off your reading and if you still can't
find it go with the clue. <br />
<b>Update July 2009:</b><br />
I've increased the difficulty as this one sees a lot of DNFs
followed by finds. It's *really* small. <b>Update Sept
2009:</b><br />
Many many thanks to anacreon for helping with the latest round of
maintenance on this one</long-description>

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

The hint was very useful, the gps were pointing a place at 20m.
Even so, i didn't understand why the cache is only accessible by the parking lot... would it make a difference to moved one or two meters so people could reach it from the outside?

Thanks for this one...
