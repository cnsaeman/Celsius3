<p><b>Howth Harbour</b></p></center></description>
  <long-description><p>Originally just a small fishing village, Howth is now a busy
suburb of Dublin. The village of Howth spans most of the northern
part of Howth Head, a Peninsula which is connected to the rest of
Fingal via a narrow strip of land at nearby Sutton. In the past,
Howth could become isolated from the mainland during stormy weather
and high tides.</p>
<br />
<p>The island of Ireland's Eye, part of the Howth Estate, lies
about a kilometre north of Howth harbour, with Lambay Island some 5
km further to the north. A Martello tower exists on each of these
islands with another tower overlooking Howth harbour. These are
part of a series of towers built around the coast of Ireland during
the 19th century. At the south-east corner of Howth Head is the
automated Baily Lighthouse. Howth is a popular area for
birdwatching and sailing, and is also popular with anglers. It is
also an extremely popular area for tourists in the summer.</p>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-16T19:00:00Z : Found it by RoobyDoo <br />What a cracking multi!
Had a splendid lunch in the Boody Stream before setting off. Managed to see the seals, almost every inch of the harbour and have a very nice ice cream aswell.
Retrieving the cache required extreme stealth, but it was well worth it.
Thanks for such a great time in Howth

But as we are neither birds nor fishes we had to walk through this pretty harbour.
