  <long-description><p><b>The Martello Tower</b></p>
<p>The Irish coastline is dotted with the famous Martello Towers,
small round towers with flat roofs. These towers were designed and
built as lookout posts during the Napoleonic Wars. Should an
invading ship be spotted by one of the lookouts in the tower, he
would make his way to the roof and set fire to a bundle of
wood.</p>
<p>This signal would eventually be seen by the next tower location,
who in turn would do the same until all the towers along the coast
would be notified of an approaching unidentified vessel.</p>
<p>One of twelve such fortifications in north County Dublin, the
remains of one Martello tower can be seen at the coast in
Balbriggan. The towers were erected between 1804 - 1815 in response
to rumours of a Napoleonic invasion, which never took place. Named
after their prototype at Cape Mortella in Corsica these formidable
bastions possessed 8 feet (2.4m) thick walls. With a large cannon
was mounted on a traversing carriage on the roof. The towers never
did fire a shot in anger and they fell into disuse. Some 39 still
survive in Ireland, many around the Dublin area.</p>
<p>Nearby, in ruinous condition, are two boat houses the larger of
which was used for many years as a Sea Bath House, and was much
frequented by visitors to the town. The nearby park was once the
site of an imposing Coast Guard Station built around 1864, and
destroyed during the Irish War of Independence in 1922.</p>
<p>There are plans to build the new Irish seal rescue center on
lands donated by Fingal county council near the Martello tower.
http://www.irishsealsanctuary.ie/ and also restore the ruins of the
coast guard station.</p>

<p><b>The Mounds</b></p>
<p>The oldest known verified site in the area is in the townland of
Bremore (from the Irish Big Hills) - situated on the coast just
north of the town. According to its records, its name is derived
from five mounds. Locally known as the Fairy Mounds, these mounds
were surveyed in 1960 and have been identified as passage graves of
the same era as Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth of the Boyne Valley
(around 2500 BC).</p>
<p>Of the five mounds the central on is the largest at over 3m tall
and 30m across. The other four appear to be satellite tombs to this
one. There may have been more to the north of the main mound at one
time, but these would have been washed into the sea so we'll never
know.</p>
<p><b>The Cache</b></p>
<p>Stage 1</p>
<p>To find the cache you must visit the Martello tower near the
above location and note the number of open windows with ledges call
this number <b>A</b></p>
<p>Stage 2</p>
<p>Go to N53 36.875 W006 11.112 take note of the number of this
bridge and call the answer <b>B.C.D</b></p>
<p>Final Location</p>
<p>To find the cache go to N53 A(A+B).D(A+D+A) W006
(A+D).B(C-A+B)(D-C+B)</p>
<p>The cache is a small sized container please rehide it well as
Muggles frequent this area.</p>

Listening to the seagulls and the gentle lapping me the waves and watching the fishing boats it wouldn't surprise me if Finbar Furey turned up to play the tin whistle.

Now for the walk back.

It's worth walking alonge this nice landscape.
