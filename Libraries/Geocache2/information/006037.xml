  <long-description><p>This small cross probably dates from the beginning of the 17th
century. On one face it has a Crucifixion set within a recessed
cross-shaped panel. This is surmounted by a winged ox, the symbol
of St Luke. This cross is mounted on a large rectangular base which
contains two bullauns, each about 20cm diameter. It is almost
directly opposite the entrance to Dunsany Castle.</p>
<p>Dunsany Castle and Demesne are situated in the townland of
Dunsany (Dun Samhnaigh or Dun Samhna), between the historic town of
Trim, with Ireland's largest castle (King John's Castle or simply
Trim Castle, a former Dunsany holding) and the large village of
Dunshaughlin on one of the country's main routes, in County
Meath.<br />
The Castle is the longest occupied home and one of the oldest
continuously inhabited buildings in Ireland, though the Lords of
Dunsany have suffered on a couple of occasions, such as when the
ninth Lord, elected by the Catholic peers of Ireland to assert
their loyalty to the State, was imprisoned for several years in
Dublin Castle before being sent to Connaught. While his family died
on the journey, he was reinstated at the time of the Restoration.
Later, the tenth Lord fought for James II at the Battle of the
Boyne and was outlawed but the estates were restored to his
successor after the Treaty of Limerick.</p>
