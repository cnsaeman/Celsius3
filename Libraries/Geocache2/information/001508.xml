<p>An extensive beach fronts the dune system, which is located
between rocky headlands at the northern and southern ends of the
beach.</p>
<p>The peninsula is made up of a series of sand dune ridges. While
sand and gravel ridges form the spine of the Burrow. Towards the
northern end plants such as Prickly Saltwort and Sea Sandwort
provide an anchor for the sand.</p>

<p>Rogerstown Estuary, of which the Burrow peninsula in Portrane is
a part, is a proposed Natural Heritage Area. It is also a
designated Special Protection Area (SPA).</p>
<p>Both the Ballyboghil and Ballough rivers flow into the sea at
the Estuary. At low tide the estuary drains and exposes the mud and
sand flats and areas of salt marsh.</p>
<p>Cord grass and Green algae grow in the muddy areas at the
northern tip of the Burrow Beach. Tassel weed also grows here and
is grazed by the Brent geese and Widgeon. Lugworm and mussels in
the outer estuary add to the food sources that attract birds,
particularly during winter months.</p>
<p>The estuary is an important link in the chain of estuaries on
the Irish East Coast and it supports an internationally important
population of Brent geese. Other species of national importance
include the Greylag Goose, Shelduck, Shoveler, Ringed and Grey
Plover and Knot and Black-Tailed Godwit. The estuary is a regular
staging post for scarce migrants especially in autumn when Green
Sandpiper, Ruff, Little Stint, Curlew Sandpiper and Spotted
Redshank are in evidence.</p>

<p>A lot of costal erosion has taken place over recent years and
the dunes to the rear of the sandy Burrow Beach have been adversely
affected by visitor traffic, a wooden walkway is now in place to
help prevent erosion caused by foot traffic to the sand dunes.</p>
<p>To log this earth cache please answer the following
questions</p>
<p>Question 1.</p>
<p>When did the modern word "dune" come into the English language
and what language and year did it appear from.</p>
<p>Question 2.</p>
<p>Name the different shapes and types of Sand Dunes.</p>
<p>Question 3.</p>
<p>How many boulders are at the above coordinates and what type of
Quartz can be seen in them.</p>
<p>Question 4.</p>
<p>What is a Glacial ridge?</p>
<p>Finally At the listed coordinates take a photo of the Sand and
Gravel ridges please include either yourself or you gps in the
photo, also estimate the wide of the Sand and Gravel ridges at this
location.</p>

We had never been here before. It's a beautiful area and we had the place to ourselves! The tide was far out as we enjoyed a stroll along the beach. We were suprised to read on the information board  that the wooden walkway that's in place to help prevent erosion was only installed in 2007. It looks like part of the scenery now it's blended in well. With the information acquired, we decided we'd head for home, then we thought...
 "Just one more?..." [:)]

TFTEC [^]</li><li>2010-01-23T20:00:00Z : Found it by Fjon <br />Familiar area. Met an old man with a metal detector here. Says this area is pretty good for finding stuff, so take note.
Will send answers.</li></ul></logs>
