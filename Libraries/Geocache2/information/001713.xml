TFTC, and G'Day from Australia</li><li>2010-05-28T19:00:00Z : Found it by tmob <br />#2461

We looked for this cache during our holidays in Ireland.
Six fantastic days, 1800kms driven, and a bunch of caches found.
Definitely a great way to get to know this beautiful island!

This was our very last cache in Ireland. I always remember the fantastic days we spent here.
Also enjoyed the container [:d]

Thanks for this one...
Greetings from Portugal</li><li>2010-05-24T19:00:00Z : Found it by eve1987 <br />This was my first cache in Ireland! Nice Box!

Today was different - dropped Mum & Dad off and then had a bit of time to spare so thought I'd finally look for this one. 

Found the parking place easily enough, parked near the bank, unhooked the GPS ready for the find and... "LOW BATTERY PRESS ENTER". Feck!!! (as they say round these parts)

So, back into the car, hook up the GPS again. Switch to map mode and study the lay of the pixels. Read the clue and then plunge in. 

Was very very easy to find and seems to be full of travel jeeps.

Dropped off SMOOCH which wants to go kiss the Blarney Stone (figure it'll get there faster from here than from the Burren) and picked up some assorted bugs for tomorrow's trip to the UK.
