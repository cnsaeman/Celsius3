  <long-description><p>The coastal walk from Portrane to Donabate Beach, featured in
the magazine “Walking World Ireland” has spectacular views of
Lambay Island, Howth Head and the Dublin Mountains. Martello
Towers, build by the British in 1806 in anticipation of a French
invasion can be seen en route.</p>
<p>There are also numerous small coves and caves, which were the
haunt of smugglers in the 18th Century. Charming names such as “The
Camel’s Hump”, “Pipers Hole”, “The Priests Chamber”, “The Chink
Well”, “The Bleeding Pig” and the “Mermaids Churn” are attributed
to some of these natural rock features.</p>

RD </li><li>2009-10-31T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />This was a lovely walk, and a lovely day for it! I have always had a great interest in Lambay Island, and this cache lives up to its name by providing some excellent views of the island (which is the easternmost land of the republic of Ireland). We found a dead baby seal on the beach, which was a sad sight. At Tower Beach we went into some caves and we saw a seagull flying carrying a starfish in its beak. Thanks for a very enjoyable and scenic cache.</li><li>2009-10-18T19:00:00Z : Found it by orangetigerprawn <br />Great cache. I loved the walk and knew the area very well. It brought back childhood memories of summers spent in a caravan in Donabate.

Go raibh maith agat.</li><li>2009-08-30T19:00:00Z : Found it by sandmartin <br />Our first multi cache! Fouund it easily and had a great day even though it started to rain. Left candle from Verona opera, took keyring. TFTC</li><li>2009-08-22T19:00:00Z : Found it by rooske <br />A brisk walk very enjoyabl as the clowds rooled in but the rain held off.</li></ul></logs>
