  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-28T19:00:00Z : Found it by Sally&eL <br />17:37 #592

... took a while to solve this one, but when we did, we realized it was not that hard after all..  
... interesting place

TFTC
</li><li>2010-05-20T19:00:00Z : Didn't find it by Asquith <br />Shame! I had high hopes for this one and managed to decode the coords relatively quickly.
At the interesting and fitting final location, I found an unusual hide/container but couldn't see how it could contain a pencil and logbook, besides which it didn't really fit in with the general theme of the cache and I didn't have a screwdriver handy to check further.
I also found a football boot hiding halfway up a tree, but the terrain attribute for this was much more than 1.5.
I finally gave up after 30 minutes as I was being observed by elderly muggles on a bench 100 yards away.
Thanks anyway for bringing me here, loved the location.</li><li>2010-04-05T19:00:00Z : Write note by dottigross <br />We solved the puzzle, but couldn't sign the logbook, because the park was closed and we were in Dublin only at the Easter holidays [V][V][V]

Thanks anyway for the puzzle.

dottigross</li><li>2010-03-26T19:00:00Z : Found it by Toffee Man <br />Found today with Blue Jay 59. BJ 59 had spent a few nights working out the co-ords & we were anxious to see the cache as all the previous finders had high praise  for this one. We were not disappointed.
