  <description>Glendougal's personal space.</description>
  <long-description>Traditional small cache located near Barnageeragh beach between Skerries and Balbriggan. Nice views northwards on a clear day.

Probably not the driest cache to be doing if the tide is high with a strong easterly breeze.</long-description>
  <encoded-hints>You know when you're searching for a cache in a forest and the hint says tree? Well here it's "rock."</encoded-hints>

  <logs><ul><li>2010-05-03T19:00:00Z : Found it by Wilddrude <br />The last cache for today was a really nice one. Fortunately the tide was low and we were able to walk there without getting wet feet.

Thanks for the cache and greetings from Germany,
