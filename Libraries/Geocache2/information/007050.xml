<br />
NOTE: The cache is not hidden at the above coordinates. You will
need to solve a puzzle to find the correct coordinates for the
cache.<br />
<br />
The Irish landscape is often beautiful, with wonderful colours and
shapes forming breathtaking scenes and patterns. However a whole
new distinct set of shapes emerges when the landscape is viewed
from above. Fascinating shapes appear that are not evident on the
ground. In many cases the patterns viewed from above can seem like
works of art.<br />
<br />
This cache offers a few glimpses of the fascinating patterns that
exist in Ireland. Some are man-made, many natural. Some are a
combination of both, where man-made structures enhance or often
intrude upon a landscape.<br />
<br />
For this cache I have selected some interesting views to
demonstrate the beauty of the landscape from above. All of the
scenes are of locations showing geocaches that I have visited. All
you need to do is identify which geocache I am highlighting! Once
you know which cache it is, you will be able to find the neccessary
info for that cache - usually in their waypoint code, e.g. GC1234X.
Once you have all the info you will be able to calculate the
coordinates for this cache!<br />
<br />
To help you on your quest here is some additional info -<br />
<br />
- All caches were active on 10/6/10<br />
- All caches are in the ROI<br />
- All twenty caches are spread over 18 different counties<br />
- I have found 17 of these caches.<br />
- I looked for 1 of them but could not find it!<br />
- I own 1 of the caches.<br />
- The red dots on the images are close to (though not always
exactly at) the location of the caches themselves.<br />
- This website may help to verify (or even find) some of your
answers -<br />

  <logs><ul><li>2010-06-10T19:00:00Z : Owner Maintenance by Bootle <br />fixed a couple of clues that lead to archived caches. All caches should be active now.</li><li>2010-03-06T20:00:00Z : Found it by Spark_ie <br />Wayhayyyy !!  [:D]  Have been working on this guy over the past few nights... A great puzzle cache, as Fjon said earlier, it's nice to know what you are supposed to be doing, unlike some other puzzles these days !!!   Actually managed to get co-ords from only identifying 17 of the pictures.. Good seen as I've only been to 2 of those caches !  A thrilling bike ride to the cache site, moreso because I was on a racer !   A great puzzle as I said, and a great feeling to pop open the lid of the cache :)  Took one GC to move it on. TFTC, Spark_ie</li><li>2009-09-06T19:00:00Z : Found it by abra123cadabra <br />Now this one was on my list for a long time. Yesterday and today we managed to locate the calculation critical images. The rest was down to some logical thinking and third digit uncertainty in one of the coordinates. This was close enough to get us out for the hunt today... after purchasing some new wellies [:)]. On our way we saw a fox closeup on the path. At GZ 0 the hint quickly led us to the hiding place. Really liked the location.

OUT: Grolsch TB, keyring and comb
IN: Geocache Smurf TB, Soaring Eagle GC, smileyman and marble</li><li>2009-06-14T19:00:00Z : Found it by daraconn <br />I got a lot of pleasure from trying to identify the pictures - some I could guess straight away, others not at all. But even with one or two unsolved, I had enough information to be able to go to the location and find the cache without difficulty. Lovely walk with the dog on a sunny afternoon between showers. Thanks for the original and enjoyable cache!</li><li>2009-05-02T19:00:00Z : Found it by Kili or bust <br />Spent aq very enjoyable few hours on Skype with Windsockers working out all the lovely places we have been. There were quite a few scratchy head moments but with all the tekky stuff at our disposal it was not to difficult to get there in the end. Then just a question of going to get it.
Thanks for a great cache and a smashing idea. It helped a great deal that we have done just about all of them but still very tricky!</li></ul></logs>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wayhayyyy !!  [:D]  Have been working on this guy over the past few nights... A great puzzle cache, as Fjon said earlier, it's nice to know what you are supposed to be doing, unlike some other puzzles these days !!!   Actually managed to get co-ords from only identifying 17 of the pictures.. Good seen as I've only been to 2 of those caches !  A thrilling bike ride to the cache site, moreso because I was on a racer !   A great puzzle as I said, and a great feeling to pop open the lid of the cache :)  Took one GC to move it on.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Now this one was on my list for a long time. Yesterday and today we managed to locate the calculation critical images. The rest was down to some logical thinking and third digit uncertainty in one of the coordinates. This was close enough to get us out for the hunt today... after purchasing some new wellies [:)]. On our way we saw a fox closeup on the path. At GZ 0 the hint quickly led us to the hiding place. Really liked the location.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I got a lot of pleasure from trying to identify the pictures - some I could guess straight away, others not at all. But even with one or two unsolved, I had enough information to be able to go to the location and find the cache without difficulty. Lovely walk with the dog on a sunny afternoon between showers. Thanks for the original and enjoyable cache!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Spent aq very enjoyable few hours on Skype with Windsockers working out all the lovely places we have been. There were quite a few scratchy head moments but with all the tekky stuff at our disposal it was not to difficult to get there in the end. Then just a question of going to get it.
Thanks for a great cache and a smashing idea. It helped a great deal that we have done just about all of them but still very tricky!</groundspeak:text>
