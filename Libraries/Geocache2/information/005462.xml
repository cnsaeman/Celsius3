Cache information:<br>
The cache is a micro one and a magnet is involved. You will need
your own pen and please use as little space as possible and please
be extremely careful retrieving and replacing the cache. THE CACHE
SHOULD BE REPLACED LOW DOWN!!<br>
The above coordinates take you to the cache, though the large
building can play havoc with the coordinates. You should be able to
see, etched on the pavement at N53 20.626 W006 16.299, a facsimile
of downtown Dubh Linn (Dublin) as it was back in Viking times.
Starting there you should be able to see a door clearly (brown
currently) with a pointed arch over it. This is a back entrance to
the cathedral (currently some renovation works taking place August
06). There will be other tell tale signs etched nearby in the
concrete at your feet (see spoiler pics). The cache is not too far.
<br>
As this is a heavily visited tourist area please be very careful
retrieving and replacing the cache. <br>
<br>
<br>
Quite a lengthy storm blew up during the planning stages of Dublin
City Council Offices which are housed on the river side of Christ
Church Cathedral. The excavations at Wood Quay unearthed some
priceless artefacts from the Viking era of Dublin history and many
concerned historians and conservationists tried to block the
construction of the offices. The citizens of Dublin were divided on
the issue and this delayed the construction for quite a few
years.<br>
In the end a compromise (or Irish solution!) was reached and the
buildings that you now see close to the cache area were erected. In
my opinion, they have to be among the ugliest creations that you
could place next to such a wonderful ancient monument, but there
you are!<br>
<br>
Part of the area you will visit near the cache included the old
street known as Fishamble Street. In an old theatre here (long
since gone) Handel's Messiah was famously performed for the first
time.<br>
<br>
CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL<br>
<br>
No visit to Dublin is complete without a visit to Christ Church
Cathedral. It costs 5 Euro per adult to visit the inside of the
cathedral (not necessary for the cache). This is the mother church
of the diocese of Dublin and Glendalough.<br>
Viking Dublin’s cathedral was built on this site c.1030 and briefly
became a cathedral priory under the Benedictines. In 1162 the
archbishop of Dublin, Laurence O’Toole (Lorcan Ua Tuathail-later
canonised) introduced the canons regular of St Augustine to the
cathedral where they remained until the Reformation. The
cathedral’s present shape dates from the 1180s rebuilding under
John Cumin, the first Anglo-Norman archbishop. When Henry VIII
broke from Rome in the 1530s the Irish church, however reluctantly,
had to follow suit.<br>
The liturgy followed English usage and language. The Church of
Ireland maintains that, having passed through the Reformation,
faith reformed but succession unbroken, it is directly descended
from celtic and medieval Christianity and is today a continuing
part of Christ’s one holy catholic and apostolic Church in this
land.<br>
Christian worship is the primary purpose of the cathedral and
visitors of all denominations are welcome at Sunday and weekday
services.<br>
There have been major restorations of the cathedral over the
centuries. Christ Church 2000 is a €5m restoration appeal which has
conserved the crypt. Other exterior work is ongoing. Some visitors
express surprise at being asked to give a donation on entering a
church. Neither Ireland or Britain has a Church Tax for the
architectural maintenance of ancient churches.<br>
<br>
Before leaving the cathedral please say a prayer for the
Archbishop, the Dean and Chapter and the Board and all who work
here: for the unity of all Christian people: for the Lord Mayor and
Corporation and citizens of Dublin.<br>
<br>
Strongbow, leader of the Cambro-Normans captured Dublin in 1170,
and was buried in the cathedral in 1176. The original tomb was
destroyed when the wall above and roof collapsed in 1562. The
business life of Dublin, which centred on the old monument for the
payment of rents, meant that a “new” Strongbow had to be provided.
The replacement is from the 14th century and has some fine details
of medieval armour, including rowel spurs on the ankles. The small
figure alongside is believed to be a fragment from the original
monument.<br>
<br>
The Crypt of Christ Church Cathedral dates from the late 12th
century and is not only the largest medieval crypt in either
Britain or Ireland but also the oldest structure in Dublin. It is
unusual in stretching under the nave as well as the choir of the
upper church. 175ft/63.4m long, it is a forest of heavy rough-stone
pillars which carries the entire weight of the cathedral and
central tower. It contains many historic artefacts which have
survived here simply because they were in no one’s way.<br>
<br>
Statues of Charles I and Charles II among many other features
remain in the crypt.<br>
 The cathedral itself houses many ancient and interesting
items:<br>
<br>
Musicians corner, the Baptistry, The Civic Pew, The 15th Century
Brass Medieval Lectern, The Sedilia, The Screens, The South
Transept, The Peace Chapel of St Laud, The Lady Chapel, and many
more.<br></long-description>
