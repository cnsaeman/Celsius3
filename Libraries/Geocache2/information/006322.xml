  <long-description><p>This cache is located in the ruins of the Baldungan church and
tower, located somewhere between Rush, Lusk, Loughshinny, and
Skerries in Fingal (appproximately 20 miles north of Dublin). All
that remains of the Church are the outer walls of the church, and
the tower. Unfortunately access to the tower is closed off. There
is a small cemetary around the castle, which is still in use.</p>
<p>A nice place with a great view, this is a nice location off the
beaten track along the coast of Ireland. The cache itself (a small
tablock box) should not be too hard to find, so when you're in the
neighbourhood, make sure to visit!</p>
