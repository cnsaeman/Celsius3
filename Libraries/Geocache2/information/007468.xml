  <long-description>This cache is located near Drumanagh Martello Tower which is
situated between the North Beach of Rush and Loughshinny harbour.
There are numerous ways to visit this cache from the easy cliff
walks via the North Beach of Rush (home of The Windsockers) or the
cliff walk from Loughshinny Harbour. 
<p>For those of you not wishing for a cliff walk you can find a
place to park your car at</p>
N 53° 32.414 W 006° 05.637 and follow the lane at N 53° 32.342 W
006° 05.541 
<p>Public transport from Dublin City center is by bus no 33a which
stops beside the above locations</p>
<p>Care is needed when walking in the rough as there's quite a few
rabbit holes that could cause a nasty fall.</p>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>About Drumanagh</p>
Drumanagh which is fortified by a great earthwork Stretching across
the neck of the promontory. This earthwork comprises the main bank
which is up to 30’ thick at the base and 6’ high. Outside this are
the fosse and also the track of two other parallel banks separated
by filled in fosses. At the northern extremity there was formerly a
spring well in the fosse but this is now dried up. The bank is over
400 yards long and is one of the largest promontory forts in the
country. The Headland is bounded on the other three sides by
vertical cliffs about 50 feet high and was therefore a very
strongly defended position. There is no indication of habitation
enclosed by these defenses, But near the end of the headland is a
Martello Tower in a very exposed situation it is built to the usual
design, the internal floor is missing but otherwise it appears to
be in good Condition. <br />

I hooked up with Kokatrain, Mary Love, Glendougle amf Morninglark fo find a few that had been on the cards for a while; mostly revisits for some of us with a bit more man power. Knowing the Windsocker's love of walking I decided that there had to be an easier way to get to the cache rather than hiking up from Loughshinny. With the help of Dr Google I decided we should tackle the cache from the lane leading from the bus stops near Kenure Lodge.

Perhaps we should have walked down, or even gone in just one car but that would have been too sensible. The laneway narrowed, got muddy and had potholes the size of Cavan. The cars bottomed out a couple of ways down and were destroyed with mud by the time we got to the parking spot I'd seen on Google.

The cache find itself was easier than expected. The coordinates were spot on though there were so many possible hiding places. Fortunately, with in a minute or so Mary Love fell on it.  We signed the log and dropped off a geocoin.

Getting back to the cars was easier than getting back to the road. Turning the cars in the mudbath was an interesting experience and I imagined myself giving the cache owner a call to come up and pull us out. We kept the windows closed and fortunately made it out in one piece
