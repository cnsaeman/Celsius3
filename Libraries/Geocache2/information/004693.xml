  <long-description><p>In 1866, the beautiful little Kenure Church, on the Skerries
Road, was built and endowed by the Palmers. The building was
designed by James Edward Rogers, (1838-1896), (who also designed
the Church of Ireland church in Skerries), and built by Gilbert
Cockburn and Son, at a cost of approximately £1200. The buildings
is of cut limestone with bands of red sandstone, and is surmounted
by a one arch bell turret, the arch of which is carried on marble
shafts, as are the window arches. The porch is of Portland stone
and red sandstone, finely moulded and carved.</p>
<p>Over the communion table is a beautiful stained glass window in
memory of Mary Ellen Peel, nee Ellen Palmer, who was the daughter
of Sir Roger Palmer, the 4th Baronet. She married Archie Peel, a
nephew of the Prime Minister, but she died tragically, ten days
after giving birth to her third child, in 1863. Her colourful and
romantic life is described in Betty Askwith's introduction to
"Crimean Courtship", in which Ellen's recently discovered diaries
are published</p>
<p>There is also a circular stained glass window in the western
gable of the chapel, which is unusual and exquisite. Even the roof
slates of the building are set in a shaded pattern of diamonds and
the building is in a peaceful setting surrounded by trees. In 1899,
Archbishop Peacock of Dublin consecrated the burial ground around
the church. On that occasion, Sir Roger Palmer read the lesson, and
Lady Gertrude presided at the organ, and "conducted the psalmody of
a hearty and efficient choir". The congregation and clergy
afterwards dined in Kenure House.</p>
