This cache is one of six in the "Dublin's Railway Termini" series.
The full series, consisting of Westland Row, Amiens Street,
Kingsbridge, North Wall, Broadstone and Harcourt Street will bring
you to the railway termini, both past and present, of Dublin city
and will hopefully give you an appreciation for the vast railway
network that once served the city. Today the railway buildings
remain as impressive and imposing structures within their
surrounding localities. While some of the buildings remain in use
as railway stations, others are sadly neglected relics of Dublin's
railway past. <br />
<br />
Inside the lid of each cache you will find 2 numbers printed in red
and white lettering. Gather all 12 numbers and you will be able to
ascertain the coordinates for an exclusive 7th cache relating to
Dublin's railway history. <br />
<br />
Dublin Heuston is one of Republic of Ireland's main railway
stations, serving the south, southwest and west. It is operated by
Iarnród Éireann, the national railway operator. It houses the head
office of Iarnród Éireann's parent company, Córas Iompair Éireann
(CIÉ). <br />
<br />
Heuston was called Kingsbridge Station from its opening on 4 August
1846, until its renaming in 1966 after Sean Heuston, an Easter
Rising leader who had worked in the station offices. The
"Kingsbridge" appellation is still common amongst native Dubliners.
The station was designed by Sancton Wood and the handsome original
buildings remain. When it was opened, the station was the largest
enclosed structure on earth. <br />
<br />
Heuston is connected to Connolly Station by the Red Line of the
Luas light rail system. As this system is built to a different
gauge and runs through a bus & tram plaza at the front of the
station rather than from the platform areas in the interior,
through running is not possible. There is a physical rail link
between the two stations via Islandbridge Junction (less than a
mile from Heuston) but this is usually only used for freight and
rolling stock movements — once or twice a year special trains may
operate, usually from Cork to Connolly for Gaelic Athletic
Association matches in Croke Park. <br />
<br />
There are nine platforms - eight terminal platforms and one through
platform. <br />
<br />
Intercity and Commuter services leave the station on a triple line
to Inchicore and double beyond. This is the main line to Cork,
serving Kildare and junction for Kilkenny & Waterford;
Portarlington, diverging route to west via Tullamore and Athlone;
Portlaoise; Ballybrophy, junction for Limerick via Nenagh; Thurles;
Limerick Junction, for direct Limerick and Ennis services and
Waterford via Clonmel; Mallow, junction for Killarney & Tralee.
<br />
<br />
The main maintenance depot, at Inchicore, is approximately three
kilometres (two miles) away.<br />
<br />
The cache is a micro. Please replace it exactly as you found it,
making sure it is not visible. Enjoy!<br />
