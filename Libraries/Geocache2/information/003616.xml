Cache information:<br />
This cache is now a magnetic nano.<br />
The above coordinates bring you to a point in the park beside St
Patrick's Cathedral. Close by, as part of Dublin's millenium
celebrations, a gallery of Irish writers were commemorated. Three
of them won Nobel Prizes for Literature. Add the year that each
gained that honour (without the "19") and add 203 to your answer.
The cache is at N53 20.392 W 006 16.???<br />
Being a centre city cache there are likely to be many people around
so please retrieve and replace the cache with extreme care. NB. The
cache can be retrieved from within the park itself during normal
opening hours. There is no need to enter the enclosed area beyond
that.<br />
The building in question has a huge influence on the GPS signal
received so you may have to use the hint to get close.<br />

The National Cathedral and Collegiate Church of Saint Patrick
Dublin (Ireland) Ard-Eaglais Naomh P&aacute;draig<br />
<br />
<br />
"...built in hewn stone, in the form of a cross, right goodly to be
seen with fair embowed works, fine pavements, and an arched roof
overhead of stonework... solemnly dedicated to God, our Blessed
Lady Mary and St. Patrick..."<br />
The English invasion under Henry II in the second half of the
twelfth-century resulted in significant reforms within the Church
in Ireland. In 1191 John Comyn, the first Anglo-Norman Archbishop
of Dublin, raised the little church of St Patrick's on the island
to the status of a collegiate church; that is, a church served by a
large body of clergy devoted equally to worship and learning. Part
of his motivation lay in Norman dislike for monastic orders.
Perhaps more importantly, by building his own palace and church
outside the City walls on his own territory Comyn was no longer
subject to the jurisdiction of the city provosts. He gave the
income of a number of his parishes or prebends to support the
clergy and some of the prebends still bear the names of these
parishes to this day. Comyn's charter of 1191 was confirmed by a
bull of Pope Celestine III in the same year. It is believed that
the baptistery at the entrance to the cathedral is the only
surviving part of Comyn's church.<br />
Why are there two Cathedral's in Dublin?<br />
St Patrick's Cathedral<br />
Christ Church Cathedral<br />
<br />
It is not known precisely when St Patrick's was elevated to
cathedral status. It seems possible that this occurred during the
episcopacy of John Comyn as Henry of London, his successor, was
elected by both the chapters of Christ Church and St Patrick's and
this election was recognised by Pope Innocent III. The existence of
two cathedrals in one city was entirely without precedent and it
would seem that it was originally intended that St Patrick's, a
secular cathedral, would replace Christ Church, the regular
cathedral. This was obviously resisted by Christ Church resulting
in the unusual situation of two cathedrals, each possessing the
rights of cathedral of the diocese. With the disestablishment of
the Church of Ireland in 1870, St Patrick's became the national
cathedral with canonical representation in the chapter from every
diocese in Ireland, while Christ Church became cathedral for the
united dioceses of Dublin, Glendalough and Kildare with Kildare
ceded to Meath in 1976<br />

JONATHAN SWIFT<br />
(Author of Gullivers Travels)<br />
Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin in 1667. His father died before
he was born, so he was brought to England by his mother, where he
was brought up by aunts and uncles. He received his education at
Kilkenny College and entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1682. He
spent some time as secretary to Sir William Temple, a former
diplomat and writer, at Moor Park in Surrey and it was here that he
met Esther Johnson, know as Stella in his writings.. In 1694 he was
ordained into the ministry of the Church of Ireland and his first
parish was Kilroot in county Antrim. He was appointed vicar of
Laracor in county Meath in 1699 and remained in this position for
the rest of his life. An altar table from this church can be seen
in the cathedral. The following year he was appointed to the
prebendary of Dunlavin in St Patrick&rsquo;s cathedral giving him
some standing in the church. During this period he managed to
secure for the Irish clergy remission of certain taxes on their
incomes, originally due to Rome, but which from the time of the
reformation had been retained by the crown. Despite this, his
outspoken manner stood in the way of preferment and instead of the
bishopric he had hoped for, he was appointed dean of St
Patrick&rsquo;s, a position which he held from
1713&mdash;1745.<br />
As dean, Swift proved himself to be most conscientious both in his
religious duties and also as custodian of the building. He attended
service in the cathedral every day and established the custom of
celebrating the Eucharist every Sunday; the only church in Dublin
at the time to have such a practice. He was responsible for
restoring several of the monuments in the cathedral and was well
known for his charity to the inhabitants of his liberty&mdash;he
built an Alms house for old women who were no longer able to
maintain themselves.<br />
Swift's epitaph can be seen in the cathedral. In translation it
reads:<br />
Here is laid the body of Jonathan Swift, Doctor of Divinity, Dean
of this Cathedral Church, where fierce indignation can no longer
rend the heart. Go, traveller, and imitate if you can this earnest
and dedicated champion of liberty. He died on the 19th day of
October 1745 AD. Aged 78 years.<br />

The Installation of Albert Prince of Wales as Knight of the Most
Illustrious Order of St Patrick 18th April 1868 The Most
Illustrious Order of St Patrick was founded by King George III in
1783 as an honour for the more influential peers in Ireland. It was
to be similar in structure to the Order of the Garter in England
and the Scottish Order of the Thistle. The Lord Lieutenant George
Grenville Nugent Temple, later Marquis of Buckingham was the first
Grand Master and the Dean of St Patrick's was the Registrar. St
Patrick's Cathedral was the Chapel of the Order and the Great Hall
in Dublin Castle, now known as St Patrick's Hall, was the Chancery
where Knights were normally installed and where banquets were held
on St Patrick's Day. The first installation took place in the
Cathedral on 17 March 1783.<br />
To qualify for membership each Knight had to be a "gentleman of
blood without reproach and descended of three descents of
noblesse".Each Knight had to send to the cathedral his banner, a
symbolic sword, a symbolic helmet and crest and to arrange with the
King of Arms to have a hatchment made of his arms. These were to be
placed on or above the stall in the choir to which he was allotted,
there to remain for his lifetime. The present banners represent
those of the knights in 1864 to which were added those of the
Prince of Wales (1868) and the Duke of Connaught (1869).<br />
The last great ceremony held in the St Patrick's was in 1868 when
the Prince of Wales was invested as a knight. At the
disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, the Order was
secularised and the association with St Patrick's Cathedral
ceased.<br /></long-description>
